Foreword
by Yehudi Menuhin
The practice of Yoga induces a primary sense of measure and proportion.
Reduced to our own body, our fi rst instrument, we learn to play it,
drawing from it maximum resonance and harmony. With unflagging
patience we refine and animate every cell as we return daily to the
attack, unlocking and liberating capacities otherwise condemned to
frustration and death.
Each unfulfilled area of tissue and nerve, of brain or lung, is a
challenge to our will and integrity, or otherwise a source of frustratkm
and death. Whoever has had the privilege of receiving Mr I yengar's
attention, or of wimessing the precision, refinement and beauty of his
art, is introduced to that vision of perfection and innocence which is
man as first created-unarmed, unashamed, son of God, lord of creation
-in the Garden of Eden. The tree of knowledge has indeed yielded much
fruit of great variety, sweet, poisonous, bitter, wholesome according to
our use of it. But is it not more imperative than ever that we cultivate
the tree, that we nourish its roots? And furthermore how dangerous is
that knowledge to those who, ill at ease with themselves, would rather
apply it to the manipulation of other people and things than to the
improvement of their own persons.
The practice of Yoga over the past fifteen years has convinced me that
most of our fundamental attitudes to life have their physical counterparts
in the body. Thus comparison and criticism must begin with the align­
ment of our own left and right sides to a degree at which even finer
adjustments are feasible : or strength of will will cause us to start by
stretching the body from the toes to the top of the head in defiance of
gravity. Impetus and ambition might begin with the sense of weight and
speed that comes with free-swinging limbs, instead of with the control
of prolonged balance on foot, feet or hands, which gives poise. Tenacity
is gained by stretching in various Yoga postures for minutes at a time,
while calmness comes with quiet, consistent breathing and the expan­
sion of the lungs. Continuity and a sense of the universal come with
the knowledge of the inevitable alternation of tension and relaxation in
eternal rhythms of which each inhalation and exhalation constitutes one
cycle, wave or vibration among the countless myriads which are the
umverse.

Foreword

What is the alternative? Thwarted, warped people condemning the
order of things, cripples criticising the upright, autocrats slumped in
expectant coronary attitudes, the tragic spectacle of people working out
their own imbalance and frustration on others.
Yoga, as practised by Mr Iyengar, is the dedicated votive offering of
a man who brings himself to the altar, alone and clean in body and mind,
focussed in attention and will, offering in simplicity and innocence not
a burnt sacrifice, but simply himself raised to his own highest potential.
It is a technique ideally suited to prevent physical and mental illness
and to protect the body generally, developing an inevitable sense of self­
reliance and assurance. By its very nature it is inextricably associated
with universal laws : for respect for life, truth, and patience are all indis­
pensable factors in the drawing of a quiet breath, in calmness of mind
and firmness of will.
In this lie the moral virtues inherent in Yoga. For these reasons it
demands a complete and total effort, involving and forming the whole
human being. No mechanical repetition is involved and no lip-service
as in the case of good resolutions or formal prayers. By its very nature
it is each time and every moment a living act.
Mr Iyengar's Light on Yoga will, I hope, enable many to follow his
example and to become the teachers whom mankind so sorely needs.
If this book will serve to spread this basic art and will ensure that it is
practised at the highest level, I shall feel more than ever grateful for
having shared in its presentation.

Preface

It is only thanks to the persistent encouragement of my devoted friends
and pupils that this book is now achieved -for alone I would have
repeatedly faltered not only because of my inadequate command of the
English language but because I would have lost heart without their
buoyant support and assurance.
Yoga is a timeless pragmatic science evolved over thousands of years
dealing with the physical, moral, mental and spiritual well-being of man
as a whole.
The first book to systematise this practice was the classic treatise the
Yoga Sutras (or Aphorisms) of Patafljali dating from 200 BC. Unfor­
tunately most of the books published on Yoga in our day have been
unworthy of both the subject and its first great exponent, as they are
superficial, popular and at times misleading. I have even been asked by
their readers whether I can drink acid, chew glass, walk through fire,
make myself invisible or perform other magical acts. Scholarly and
reliable expositions of the religious and philosophical texts already exist
in most languages- but the practice of an art is more difficult to com­
municate than a purely literary or philosophical concept.
The title of this book is Light on Yoga (Yoga Di'pika in Sanskrit), as
my purpose is to describe as simply as possible the asanas (postures)
and pranayamas (breathing disciplines) in the new light of our own era,
its knowledge and its requirements. Instructions on asana and pranayama
are therefore given in great detail and are based on my experience for
over twenty-seven years in many parts of the world. It contains the
complete technique of zoo asanas with 592 photographs from which the
asanas can be mastered : and it also covers bandha, kriya and pranayama
with a further 5 photographs.
The Western reader may be surprised at the recurring reference to
the Universal Spirit, to mythology and even to philosophical and moral
principles. He must not forget that in ancient times all the higher
achievements of man, in knowledge, art and power, were part of religion
and were assumed to belong to God and to His priestly servants on
earth. The Catholic Pope is the last such embodiment of divine know­
ledge and power in the West. But formerly, even in the Western world,
music, painting, architecture, philosophy and medicine, as well as wars,

14 Preface
were always in the service of God. It is only very recently in India that
these arts and sciences have begun to be emancipated from the Divine­
but with due respect, for the emancipation of man's will, as distinct from
the Divine will, we in India continue to value the purity of purpose,
the humility of discipline and the selflessness that are the legacy of our
long bondage to God. I consider it important as well as interesting that
the reader should know the origin of asanas, and I have, therefore,
included legends handed down by practising yogis and sages.
All the ancient commentaries on yoga have stressed that it is essential
to work under the direction of a GURU (Master), and although my
experience proves the wisdom of this rule, I have endeavoured with all
humility in this book to guide the reader- both teacher and student- to
a correct and safe method of mastering these asanas and prai].ayamas.
In Appendix I , I have introduced a 300 weeks' course for the intense
practitioner, grouping the asanas stage by stage according to their
structure.
In Appendix II, I have arranged groups of asanas for their therapeutic
and curative value.
Study in detail the hints and cautions before attempting the asana
and pranayama techniques.
I am sincerely grateful to my esteemed friend and pupil Mr Yehudi
Menuhin for his foreword and immeasurable support.
I am indebted to my pupil Mr B. I . Taraporewala for his collabora­
tion in the preparation of this book.
I thank Messrs Allen and Unwin for their gesture in publishing this
exhaustively illustrated book and presenting my work to a world-wide
public, and Eilean Pearcey for providing the drawings.
I express my sincere gratitude to Messrs G. G. Welling of Poona
(India), for their personal supervision and interest in taking innumerable
photographs for me and for placing the resources of their studio at my
disposal.
The author wishes to express his gratitude to Mr Gerald Yorke for
the care with which he dealt with the editing of the typescript and
subsequent proof correction.

Introduction

What is Yoga?

The word Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj meaning to bind,
join, attach and yoke, to direct and concentrate one's attention on, to
use and apply. It also means union or communion. It is the true union
of our will with the will of God. 'It thus means,' says Mahadev Desai
in his introduction to the Gita according to Gandhi, 'the yoking of all
the powers of body, mind and soul to God; it means the disciplining of
the intellect, the mind, the emotions, the will, which that Yoga l?re­
supposes; it means a poise of the soul which enables one to look at life
in all its aspects evenly.'
Yoga is one of the six orthodox systems of Indian philosophy. It was
collated, co-ordinated and systematised by PataiijiHi in his classical
work, the Yoga Sutras, which consists of 185 terse aphorisms. In Indian
thought, everything is permeated by the Supreme Universal Spirit
(Paramatma or God) of which the individual human spirit (j1vatma) is a
part. The system of yoga is so called because it teaches the means by
which the j1vatma can be united to, or be in communion with the
Paramatma, and so secure liberation (mok�a).
One who follows the path of Yoga is a yogi or yogin.
In the sixth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, which is the most important
authority on Yoga philosophy, Sri Krishna explains to Arjuna the mean­
ing of Yoga as a deliverance from contact with pain and sorrow. It is said :
'When his mind, intellect and self (aharilkara) are under control, freed
from restless desire, so that they rest in the spirit within, a man becomes
a Yukta- one in communion with God. A lamp does not flicker in a
place where no winds blow; so it is with a yogi, who controls his mind,
intellect and self, being absorbed in the spirit within him. When the
restlessness of the mind, intellect and self is stilled through the practice
of Yoga, the yogi by the grace of the Spirit within himself finds fulfil­
ment. Then he knows the joy eternal which is beyond the pale of the
senses which his reason cannot grasp. He abides in this reality and moves
not therefrom. He has found the treasure above all others. There is
nothing higher than this. He who has achieved it, shall not be moved by
the greatest sorrow. This is the real meaning of Yoga - a deliverance
from contact with pain and sorrow.'

20

Light on Yoga

As a well cut diamond has many facets, each reflecting a different
colour of light, so does the word yoga, each facet reflecting a different
shade of meaning and revealing different aspects of the entire range of
human endeavour to win inner peace and happiness.
The Bhagavad Gztii also gives other explanations of the term yoga and
lays stress upon Karma Yoga (Yoga by action). It is said: 'Work alone
is your privilege, never the fruits thereof. Never let the fruits of action
be your motive; and never cease to work. Work in the name of the Lord,
abandoning selfish desires. Be not affected by success or failure. This
equipoise is called Yoga.'
Yoga has also been described as wisdom in work or skilful living
amongst activities, harmony and moderation.
'Yoga is not for him who gorges too much, nor for him who starves
himself. It is not for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who stays
awake. By moderation in eating and in resting, by regulation in working
and by concordance in sleeping and waking, Yoga destroys all pain and
sorrow.'
The Kathopanishad describes Yoga thus : 'When the senses are stilled,
when the mind is at rest, when the intellect wavers not-then, say the
wise, is reached the highest stage. This steady control of the senses and
mind has been defined as Yoga. He who attains it is free from delusion.'
In the second aphorism of the first chapter of the Yoga Sutras,
Patafi.jali describes Yoga as 'chitta v�tti nirodhah'. This may be trans­
lated as the restraint (nirodhah) of mental (chitta) modifications (v�tti)
or as suppression (nirodhah) of the fluctuations (vrtti) of consciousness
(chitta). The word chitta denotes the mind in its total or collective sense
as being composed of three categories: (a) mind (manas, that is, the
individual mind having the power and faculty of attention, selection and
rejection; it is the oscillating indecisive faculty of the mind) ; (b) intel­
ligence or reason (buddhi, that is, the decisive state which determines
the distinction between things) and (c) ego (aharilkara, literally the
1-maker, the state which ascertains that 'I know').
The word v�tti is derived from the Sanskrit root v�t meaning to turn,
to revolve, to roll on. It thus means course of action, behaviour, mode
of being, condition or mental state. Yoga is the method by which the
restless mind is calmed and the energy directed into constructive
channels. As a mighty river which when properly harnessed by dams
and canals, creates a vast reservoir of water, prevents famine and pro­
vides abundant power for industry; so also the mind, when controlled,
provides a reservoir of peace and generates abundant energy for human
uplift.

lntroduct£on

21

The problem of controlling the mind is not capable of easy solution,
as borne out by the follow�ng dialogue in the sixth chapter of the
Bhagavad Gfta. Arjuna asks Sri Krishna :
'Krishna, you have told me of Yoga as a communion with Brahman (the
Universal Spirit), which is ever one. But how can this be permanent,
since the mind is so restless and inconsistent? The mind is impetuo�s
and stubborn, strong and wilful, as difficult to harness as the wind.' Sri
Krishna replies : 'Undoubtedly, the mind is restless and hard to control.
But it can be trained by constant practice (abhyasa) and by freedom
from desire (vairagya). A man who cannot control his mind will find it
difficult to attain this divine communion; but the self-controlled man
can attain it if he tries hard and directs his energy by the right means.'

THE STAGES OF YOGA
The right means are just as important as the end in view. Pataiijali
enumerates these means as the eight limbs or stages of Yoga for the
quest of the soul. They are:
I. Yama (universal !.llOral commandments); 2. Niyama (self purifica­
tion by discipline) ; 3 · Asana (posture); 4· Prat:J.ayama (rhythmic control
of the breath); 5 · Pratyahara (withdrawal and emancipation of the mind
from the domination of the senses and exterior objects); 6. Dharat:J.a
(concentration) ; 7· Dhyana (meditation) and 8. Samadhi (a state of
super-consciousness brought about by profound meditation, in which
the individual aspirant (sadhaka) becomes one with the object of his
meditation- Paramatma or the Universal Spirit).
Yama and Niyama control the yogi's passions and emotions and keep
him in harmony with his fellow man. Asanas keep the body healthy and
strong and in harmony with nature. Finally, the yogi becomes free of
body consciousness. H e conquers the body and renders it a fit vehicle
for the soul. The first three stages are the outward quests (bahiranga
sadhana).
The next two stages, Prat:J.ayama and Pracyahara, teach the aspirant
to regulate the breathing, and thereby control the mind. This helps to
free the senses from the thraldom of the objects of desire. These two
stages of Yoga are known as the inner quests (antaranga sadhana).
Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi take the yogi into the innermost
recesses of his soul. The yogi does not look heavenward to find God.
He knows that HE is within, being known as the Antaratma (the Inner
Self). The last three stages keep him in harmony with himself and his
Maker. These stages are called antaratma sadhana, the quest of the
soul.
•

22

Light on Yoga

By profound meditation, the knower, the knowledge and the known
become one. The seer, the sight and the seen have no separate existence
from each other. It is like a great musician becoming one with his
instrument and the music that comes from it. Then, the yogi stands
in his own nature and realises his self (Atman), the part of the Supreme
Soul within himself.
There are different paths (margas) by which a man travels to his
Maker. The active man finds realisation through Karma Marga, in
which a man realises his own divinity through work and duty. The
emotional man finds it through Bhakti Marga, where there is realisa­
tion through devotion to and love of a personal God. The intellectual
man pursues Jiiana Marga, where realisation comes through knowledge.
The meditative or reflective man follows Yoga Marga, and realises his
own divinity through control of the mind.
Happy is the man who knows how to distinguish the real from the
unreal, the eternal from the transient and the good from the pleasant by
his discrimination and wisdom. Twice blessed is he who knows true love
and can love all God's creatures. He who works selflessly for the welfare
of others with love in his heart is thrice blessed. But the man who
combines within his mortal frame knowledge, love and selfless service
is holy and becomes a place of pilgrimage, like the confluence of the
rivers Ganga, Saraswati and Jamuna. Those who meet him become
calm and purified.
Mind is the king of the senses. One who has conquered his mind,
senses, passions, thought and reason is a king among men. He is fit for
Raja Yoga, the royal union with the Universal Spirit. He has Inner
Light.
He who has conquered his mind is a Raja Yogi. The word raja means
a king. The expression Raja Yoga implies a complete mastery of the
Self. Though Pataiiiali explains the ways to control the mind, he no­
where states in his aphorisms that this science is Raja Yoga, but calls it
A��ailga Yoga or the eight stages (limbs) of Yoga. As it implies complete
mastery of the self one may call it the science of Raja Yoga.
Swatmarama, the author of the Hatha Yoga Pradzpika (hatha =force
or determined effort) called the same path Hatha Yoga because it
demanded rigorous discipline.
It is generally believed that Raja Yoga and Ha�ha Yoga are entirely
distinct, different and opposed to each other, that the Yoga Sutras of
Pataiijali deal with Spiritual discipline and that the Hatha Yoga
Pradfpika of Swatmarama deals solely with physical discipline. It is not
so, for Ha�ha Yoga and Raja Yoga complement each other and form a
single approach towards Liberation. As a mountaineer needs ladders,
ropes and crampons as well as physical fitness and discipline to climb

Introduction

23

the icy peaks of the Himalayas, so does the Yoga aspirant need the know­
ledge and discipline of the Ha�ha Yoga of Swatmarama to reach the
heights of Raja Yoga dealt with by Pataiijali.
This path of Yoga is the fountain for the other three paths. It brings
calmness and tranquillity and prepares the mind for absolute unqualified
self-surrender to God, in which all these four paths merge into one.

Chitta V�tti (Causesfor the Modification of the Mind)
In his Yoga Sutras Pataiijali lists five classes of chitta vrtti which create
pleasure and pain. These are:

1. Pramax:ta (a standard or ideal), by which things or values are measured

by the mind or known, which men accept upon (a) direct evidence such
as perception (pratyak�a), (b) inference (anumana) and (c) testimony or
the word of an acceptable authority when the source of knowledge has
been checked as reliable and trustworthy (agama).
2. Viparyaya (a mistaken view which is observed to be such after study).
A faulty medical diagnosis based on wrong hypotheses, or the formerly
held theory in astronomy that the Sun rotates round the Earth, are
examples of viparyaya.
3· Vikalpa (fancy or imagination, resting merely on verbal expression
without any factual basis). A beggar may feel happy when he imagines
himself spending millions. A rich miser, on the other hand, may starve
himself in the belief that he is poor.

4· Nidra (sleep), where there is the absence of ideas and experiences.

When a man is sleeping soundly, he does not recall his name, family or
status, his knowledge or wisdom, or even his own existence. When a man
forgets himself in sleep, he wakes up refreshed. But, if a disturbing
thought creeps into his mind when he is dropping off, he will not rest
properly.

5· Smrti (memory, the holding fast of the impressions of objects that

one has experienced). There are people who live in their past experi­
ences, even though the past is beyond recall. Their sad or happy
memories keep them chained to the past and they cannot break their
fetters.
Pataiijali enumerates five causes of chitta vrtti creating pain (klesa).
These are:

1. Avidya (ignorance or nescience) ; (2) asmita (the feeling of indivi­

duality which limits a person and distinguishes him from a group and
which may be physical, mental, intellectual or emotional); (3) raga

24

Light on Yoga

(attachment or passion) ; (4) dve8a (aversion or revulsion) and (5)
abhinivesa (love of or thirst for life, the instinctive clinging to worldly
life and bodily enjoyment and the fear that one may be cut off from all
this by death). These causes of pain remain submerged in the mind of
the sadhaka (the aspirant or seeker). They are like icebergs barely show­
ing their heads in the polar seas. So long as they are not studiously
controlled and eradicated, there can be no peace. The yogi learns to
forget the past and takes no thought for the morrow. He lives in the
eternal present.
As a breeze ruffles the surface of a lake and distorts the images
reflected therein, so also the chitta v�tti disturb the peace of the mind.
The still waters of a lake reflect the beauty around it. When the mind
is still, the beauty of the Self is seen reflected in it. The yogi stills his
mind by constant study and by freeing himself from desires. The eight
stages of Yoga teach him the way.

Chitta Vik�epa (Distractions and Obstacles)
The distractions and obstacles which hinder the aspirant's practice of
Yoga are :

I. Vyadhi - sickness which disturbs the physical equilibrium
2. Styana -languor or lack of mental disposition for work
3· Sarilsaya - doubt or indecision

4· Pramada- indifference or insensibility
5 . Alasya-laziness
6. Avirati- sensuality, the rousing of desire when sensory objects
possess the mind
1· Bhranti Darsana - false or invalid knowledge, or illusion
8. Alabdha Bhumikatva- failure to attain continuity of thought or con­
centration so that reality cannot be seen
9· Anavasthitattva-instability in holding on to concentration which has
been attained after long practice.
There are, however, four more distractions: ( I ) dul:tkha- pain or
misery, (2) daurmansya- despair, (3) ailgamejayatva- unsteadiness of
the body and (4) svasa-prasvasa - unsteady respiration.
To win a battle, a general surveys the terrain and the enemy and plans
counter-measures. In a similar way the Yogi plans the conquest of the
Self.

Vyadhi: It will be noticed that the very first obstacle is ill-health or

sickness. To the yogi his body is the prime instrument of attainment.
If his vehicle breaks down, the traveller cannot go far. If the body is
broken by ill-health, the aspirant can achieve little. Physical health is

Introduction

25

important for mental development, as normally the mind functions
through the nervous system. When the body is sick or the nervous
system is affected, the mind becomes restless or dull and inert and con­
centration or meditation become impossible.

Styiina: A person suffering from languor has no goal, no path to follow

and no enthusiasm. His mind and intellect become dull due to inactivity
and their faculties rust. Constant flow keeps a mountain stream pure,
but water in a ditch stagnates and nothing good can flourish in it. A
listless person is like a living corpse for he can concentrate on nothing.

Samsaya: The unwise, the faithless and the doubter destroy themselves.

How can they enjoy this world or the next or have any happiness? The
seeker should have faith in himself and his master. He should have faith
that God is ever by his side and that no evil can touch him. As faith
springs up in the heart it dries out lust, ill-will, mental sloth, spiritual
pride and doubt, and the heart free from these hindrances becomes
serene and untroubled.

Pramada: A person suffering from pramada is full of self-importance,

lacks any humility and believes that he alone is wise. No doubt he knows
what is right or wrong, but he persists in his indifference to the right
and chooses what is pleasant. To gratify his selfish passions and dreams
of personal glory, he will deliberately and without scruple sacrifice
everyone who stands in his way. Such a person is blind to God's glory
and deaf to His words.

Alasya: To remove the obstacle of laziness, unflagging enthusiasm

(v'frya) is needed. The attitude of the aspirant is like that of a lover ever
yearning to meet the beloved but never giving way to despair. Hope
should be his shield and courage his sword. He should be free from
hate and sorrow. With faith and enthusiasm he should overcome the
inertia of the body and the mind.

Avirati: This is the tremendous craving for sensory objects after they

have been consciously abandoned, which is so hard to restrain. With­
out being attached to the objects of sense, the yogi learns to enjoy them
with the aid of the senses which are completely under his control. By
the practice of pratyahara he wins freedom from attachment and
emancipation from desire and becomes content and tranquil.

Bhranti Dar5ana : A person afflicted by false knowledge suffers from
delusion and believes that he alone has seen the true Light. He has a

26

Light on Yoga

powerful intellect but lacks humility and makes a show of wisdom. By
remaining in the company of great souls and through their guidance he
sets his foot firmly on the right path and overcomes his weakness.
Alabdha Bhumikatva: As a mountain climber falls to-reach the summit
for lack of stamina, so also a person who cannot overcome the inability
to concentrate is unable to seek reality. He might have had glimpses of
reality but he cannot see dearly. He is like a musician who has heard
divine music in a dream, but who is unable to recall it in his waking
moments and cannot repeat the dream.
Anavasthitattva: A person affected with anavasthitattva has by hard
work come within sight of reality. Happy and proud of his achievements
he becomes slack in his practice (sadhana). He has purity and great
power of concentration and has come to the final cross-roads of his quest.
Even at this last stage continuous endeavour is essential and he has to
pursue the path with infinite patience and determined perseverance and
must never sho� slackness which hampers progress on the path of God
realization. He must wait until divine grace descends upon him. It has
been said in the Ka!hopanishad: 'The Self is not to be realised by study
and instruction, nor by subtlety of intellect, nor by much learning, but
only by him who longs for Him, by the one whom He chooses. Verily to
such a one the Self reveals His true being.'
To overcome the obstacles and to win unalloyed happiness, Pataiijali
offered several remedies. The best of these is the fourfold remedy of
Maitri (friendliness), Karm:ta (compassion), Mudita (delight) and
Upeksa (disregard).
Maitri is not merely friendliness, but also a feeling of onen,ess with
the object of friendliness (atmlyata). A mother feels intense happiness
at the success of her children because of atmlyata, a feeling of oneness.
Patafijali recommends maitri for sukha (happiness or virtue). The yogi
cultivates maitri and atmlyata for the good and turns enemies into
friends, bearing malice towards none.
Karut:a is not merely showing pity .or compassion and shedding tears
of despair at the misery (dulfkha) of others. It is compassion coupled
with devoted action to relieve the misery of the afflicted. The yogi uses
all his resources- physical, economic, mental or moral- to alleviate the
pain and suffering of others. He shares his strength with the weak until
they become strong. He shares his courage with those that are timid until
they become brave by his example. He denies the maxim of the 'survival
of the fittest', but makes the weak strong enough to survive. He becomes
a shelter to one and all.
Mudita is a feeling of delight at the good work (punya) done by

another, even though he may be a rival. Through mudita, the yogi saves
himself from much heart-burning by not showing anger, hatred or
jealousy for another who has reached the desired goal which he himself
has failed to achieve.
Upek�a: It is not merely a feeling of disdain or contempt for the
person who has fallen into vice (apul?-ya) or one of indifference or
�uperiority towards him. It is a searching self-examination to find out
how one would have behaved when faced with the same temptations.
It is also an examination to see how far one is responsible for the state
into which the unfortunate one has fallen and the attempt thereafter
to put him on the right path. The yogi understands the faults of others
by seeing and studying them first in himself. This self-study teaches him
to be charitable to all.
The deeper significance of the fourfold remedy of maitri, karuna,
mudita and upek�a cannot be felt by an unquiet mind. My experience
has led me to conclude that for an ordinary man or woman in any com­
munity of the world, the way to achieve a quiet mind is to work with
determination on two of the eight stages of Yoga mentioned by
Pataiijali, namely, asana and pra1).ayama.
The mind (manas) and the breath (pra1).a) are intimately connected
and the activity or the cessation of activity of one affects the other.
Hence Pataiijali recommended pral?-ayama (rhythmic breath control) for
achieving mental equipoise and inner peace .

Sisya and Guru (A Pupil and a Master)

The Siva Samhitii divides sadhakas (pupils or aspirants) into four
classes. They are (1) m.fdu (feeble), (2) madhyama (average), (3)
adhimatra (superior) and (4) adhimatratama (the supreme one). The
last, the highest, is alone able to cross beyond the ocean of the manifest
world.
The feeble seekers are those who lack enthusiasm, criticise their
teachers, are rapacious, inclined to bad action, eat much, are in the power
of women, unstable, cowardly, ill, dependent, speak harshly, have weak
characters and lack virility. The Guru (Teacher or Master) guides such
seekers in the path of Mantra Yoga only. With much effort, the sadhaka
can reach enlightenment in twelve years. (The word mantra is derived
from the root 'man', meaning to think. Mantra thus means a sacred
thought or prayer to be repeated with full understanding of its meaning.
It takes a long time, perhaps years, for a mantra to take firm root in the
mind of a feeble sadhaka and still longer for it to bear fruit.)
Of even mind, capable of bearing hardship, wishing to perfect the
work, speaking gently, moderate in all circumstances, such is the
•

28

average seeker. Recognising these qualities, the Guru teaches him Laya
Yoga, which gives l iberation. (Laya means devotion, absorption or
dissolution.)
Of stable mind, capable of Laya Yoga, virile, independent, noble,
merciful, forgiving, truthful, brave, young, respectful, worshipping his
teacher, intent on the practice of Yoga, such is a superior seeker. He
can reach enlightenment after six years of practice. The Guru instructs
this forceful man in Ha�ha Yoga.
Of great virility and enthusiasm, good looking, courageous, learned
in scriptures, studious, sane of mind, not melancholy, keeping young,
regular in food, with his senses under control, free from fear, clean,
skilful, generous, helpful to all, firm, intelligent, independent, forgiving,
of good character, of gentle speech and worshipping his Guru, such is
a supreme seeker, fit for all forms of Yoga. He can reach enlighten­
ment in three years.
Although the Siva Samhita and the Hafha Yoga Pradipika mention
the period of time within which success might be achieved, Pataiijali
nowhere lays down the time required to unite the individual soul with
the Divine Universal Soul. According to him abhyasa (constant and
determined practice) and vairagya (freedom from desires) make the
mind calm and tranquil. He defines abhyasa as effort of long duration,
without interruption, performed with devotion, which creates a firm
foundation.
The study of Yoga is not like work for a diploma or a university
degree by someone desiring favourable results in a stipulated time.
The obstacles, trials and tribulations in the path of Yoga can be
removed to a large extent with the help of a Guru. (The syllable gu
means darkness and ru means light. He alone is a Guru who removes
darkness and brings enlightenment.) The conception of a Guru is deep
and significant. He is not an ordinary guide. He is a spiritual teacher
who teaches a way of life, and not merely how to earn a livelihood.
He transmits knowledge of the Spirit and one who receives such
knowledge is a si�ya, a disciple.
The relationship between a Guru and a si�ya is a very special one,
transcending that between parent and child, husband and wife or
friends. A Guru is free from egotism. He devotedly leads his sisya
towards the ultimate goal without any attraction for fame or gain. He
shows the path of God and watches the progress of his disciple, guiding
him along that path. He inspires confidence, devotion, discipline, deep
understanding and illumination through love. With faith in his pupil,
the Guru strains hard to see that he absorbs the teaching. He encour­
ages him to ask questions and to know the truth by question and
analysis.

Introduction

29

A si�ya should possess the necessary qualifications of higher
realisation and development. He must have confidence, devotion and
love for his Guru. The perfect examples of the relationship between a
Guru and a sisya are those of Yama (the God of Death) and Nachiketa
in the Ka�hopani�ad and of Sri Krishna and Arjuna in the Bhagavad
Gftii. Nachiketa and Arjuna obtained enlightenment through their
one-pointed mind, their eagerness and questioning spirit. The si�ya
should hunger for knowledge and have the spirit of humility, perse­
verance and tenacity of purpose. He should not go to the Guru merely
out of curiosity. He should possess sraddha (dynamic faith) and should
not be discouraged if he cannot reach the goal in the time he had ex­
pected. It requires tremendous patience to calm the restless mind
which is coloured by innumerable past experiences and samskara (the
accumulated residue of past thoughts and actions).
Merely listening to the words of the Guru does not enable the sisya
to absorb the teaching. This is borne out by the story of lndra and
Virochana. Indra, the king of Gods, and Virochana, a demon prince,
went together to their spiritual preceptor Brahma to obtain know­
ledge of the Supreme Self. Both stayed and listened to the same
words of their Guru. Indra obtained enlightenment, whereas Virochana
did not. Indra's memory was developed by his devotion to the subject
_
taught and by the love and faith which he had for his teacher. He had
a feeling of oneness with his Guru. These were the reasons for his
success. Virochana's memory was developed only through his intellect.
He had no devotion either for the subject taught or for his preceptor.
He remained what he originally was, an intellectual giant. He returned
a doubter. Indra had intellectual humility, while Virochana had intel­
lectual pride and imagined that it was condescending on his part to go
to Brahma. The approach of lndra was devotional while that of
Virochana was practical. Virochana was motivated by curiosity and
wanted the practical knowledge which he believed would be useful to
him later to win power.
The si�ya should above all treasure love, moderation and humility.
Love begets courage, moderation creates abundance and humility
generates power. Courage without love is brutish. Abundance without
moderation leads to over-indulgence and decay. Power without humility
breeds arrogance and tyranny. The true si�ya learns from his Guru
about a power which will never leave him as he returns to the
Primeval One, the Source of His Being.
SCidhana (A Key to Freedom)

All the important texts on Yoga lay great emphasis on sadhana or
abhyasa (constant practice). Sadhana is not just a theoretical study

30

Light on Yoga

of Yoga texts. It is a spiritual endeavour. Oil seeds must be pressed
to yield oil. Wood must be heated to ignite it and bring out the hidden
fire within. In the same way, the sadhaka must by constant practice
light the divine flame within himself.
'The young, the old, the extremely aged, even the sick and the in­
firm obtain perfection in Yoga by constant practice. Success will
follow him who practises, not him who practises not. Success in Yoga
is not obtained by the mere theoretical reading of sacred texts. Success
is not obtained by wearing the dress of a yogi or a sanyasi (a recluse),
nor by talking about it. Constant practice alone is the secret of success.
Verily, there is no doubt of this.' - (Ha!ha Yoga Pradipikii, chapter I ,
verses 64- 6.)
'As by learning the alphabet one can, through practice, rnaster all
the sciences, so by thoroughly practising first physical training one
acquires the knowledge of Truth (Tattva Jna11a), that is the real nature
of the human soul as being identical with the Supreme Spirit pervad­
ing the Universe.'- (GherarJ4 a Samhitii, chapter I, verse 5 . )
It is by the co-ordinated and concentrated efforts of his body, senses,
mind, reason and Self that a man obtains the prize of inner peace and
fulfils the quest of his soul to meet his Maker. The supreme adventure
in a man's life is his journey back to his Creator. To reach the goal
he needs well developed and co-ordinated functioning of his body,
senses, mind, reason and Self. I f the effort is not co-ordinated, he fails
in his adventure. In the third valli (chapter) of the first part of the
Kafhopani�ad, Yama (the God of Death) explains this Yoga to the
seeker Nachiketa by way of the parable of the individual in a chariot.
'Know the Atman (Self) as the Lord in a chariot, reason as the
charioteer and mind as the reins. The senses, they say, are the horses,
and their objects of desire are the pastures. The Self, when united
with the senses and the mind, the wise call the Enjoyer (Bhokt�). The
undiscriminating can never rein in his mind ; his senses are like the
vicious horses of a charioteer. The discriminating ever controls his
mind ; his senses are like disciplined horses. The undiscriminating
becomes unmindful, ever impure; he does not reach the goal, wander­
ing from one body to another. The discriminating becomes mindful,
ever pure; he reaches the goal and is never reborn. The man who has
a discriminating charioteer to rein in his mind reaches the end of the
journey - the Supreme Abode of the everlasting Spirit.'
'The senses are more powerful than the objects of desire. Greater
than the senses is the mind, higher than the mind is the reason and
superior to reason is H e - the Spirit in all. Discipline yourself by the
Self and destroy your deceptive enemy in the shape of desire.'
(Bhagavad Gzta, chapter III, verses 42-3.)

Introduction

31

To realise this not only constant practice is demanded but also
renunciation. As regards renunciation, the question arises as to what
one should renounce. The yogi does not renounce the world, for that
would mean renouncing the Creator. The yogi renounces all that
takes him away from the Lord. He renounces his own desires, knowing
that all inspiration and right action come from the Lord. He renounces
those who oppose the work of the Lord, those who spread demonic
ideas and who merely talk of moral values but do not practise them.
The yogi does not renounce action. He cuts the bonds that tie him­
self to his actions by dedicating their fruits either to the Lord or to
humanity. He believes that it is his privilege to do his duty and that
he has no right to the fruits of his actions.
While others are asleep when duty calls and wake up only to claim
their rights, the yogi is fully awake to his duty, but asleep over his
rights. Hence it is said that in the night of all beings the disciplined
and tranquil man wakes to the light.
Astiiizga Yoga - The Eight Limbs of Yoga

The Yoga Sutra of Pataiijali is divided into four chapters or pada. The
first deals with samadhi, the second with the means (sadhana) to
achieve Yoga, the third enumerates the powers (vibhiiti) that the yogi
comes across in his quest, and the fourth deals with absolution
(kaivalya).
Yama

The eight limbs of Yoga are described in the second chapter. The first
of these is yam a (ethical disciplines) - the great commandments
transcending creed, country, age and time. They are : ahimsa (non­
violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya
(continence) and aparigraha (non-coveting). These commandments are
the rules of morality for society and the individual, which if not obeyed
bring chaos, violence, untruth, stealing, dissipation and covetousness.
The roots of these evils are the emotions of greed, desire and attach­
ment, which may be mild, medium or excessive. They only bring pain
and ignorance. Pataiijali strikes at the root of these evils by changing
the direction of one's thinking along the five principles of yama.
Ahimsii. The word ahimsa is made up of the particle 'a' meaning 'not'

and the noun himsa meaning killing or violence. It is more than a
negative command not to kill, for it has a wider positive meaning, love.
This love embraces all creation for we are all children of the same
Father- the Lord. The yogi believes that to kill or to destroy a thing or
being is to insult its Creator. Men either kill for food or to protect

32

Light on Yoga

themselves from danger. But merely because a man is a vegetarian,
it does not necessarily follow that he is non-violent by temperament
or that he is a yogi, though a vegetarian diet is a necessity for the
practice of yoga. Blood-thirsty tyrants may be vegetarians, but violence
is a state of mind, not of diet. It resides in a man's mind and not in the
instrument he holds in his hand. One can use a knife to pare fruit or to
stab an enemy. The fault is not in the instrument, but in the user.
Men ·take to violence to protect their own interests- their own
bodies, their loved ones, their property or dignity. But a man cannot
rely upon himself alone to protect himself or others. The belief that
he can do so is wrong. A man must rely upon God, who is the source
of all strength. Then he will fear no evil.
Violence arises out of fear, weakness, ignorance or restlessness. To
curb it what is most needed is freedom from fear. To gain this
freedom, what is required is a change of outlook on life and reorienta­
tion of the mind. Violence is bound to decline when men learn to base
their faith upon reality and investigation rather than upon ignorance and
supposition.
The yogi believes that every creature has as much right to live
as he has. He believes that he is born to help others and he looks upon
creation with eyes of love. He knows that his life is linked inextric­
ably with that of others and he rejoices if he can help them to be happy.
He puts the happiness of others before his own and becomes a source
of joy to all who meet him. As parents encourage a baby to walk the
first steps, he encourages those more unfortunate than himself and
makes them fit for survival.
For a wrong done by others, men demand ;ustice ; while for that
done by themselves they plead mercy and forgiveness. The yogi on
the other hand, believes that for a wrong done by himself, there should
be justice, while for that done !:>y another there should be forgiveness.
He knows and teaches others how to live. Always striving to perfect
himself, he shows them by his love and compassion how to improve
themselves.
The yogi opposes the evil in the wrong-doer, but not the wrong­
doer. He prescribes penance not punishment for a wrong done. Opposi­
tion to evil and love for the wrong-doer can live side by side. A
drunkard's wife whilst loving him may still oppose his habit. Opposi­
tion without love leads to violence; loving the wrong-doer without
opposing the evil in him is folly and leads to misery. The yogi knows
that to love a person whilst fighting the evil in him is the right course
to follow. The battle is won because he fights it with love. A loving
mother will sometimes beat her child to cure it of a bad habit; in the
same way a true follower of ahimsa loves his opponent.

Introduction

33

Along with ahimsa go abhaya (freedom from fear) and akrodha
(freedom from anger). Freedom from fear comes only to those who
lead a pure life. The yogi fears none and none need fear him, because
he is purified by the study of the Self. Fear grips a man and paralyses
him. He is afraid of the future, the unknown and the unseen. He is
afraid that he may lose his means of livelihood, wealth or reputation.
But the greatest fear is that of death. The yogi knows that he is
different from his body, which is a temporary house for his spirit.
He sees all beings in the Self and the Self in all beings and therefore
he loses all fear. Though the body is subject to sickness, age, decay
and death, the spirit remains unaffected. To the yogi death is the sauce
that adds zest to life. He has dedicated his mind, his reason and his
whole life to the Lord. When he has linked his entire being to the
Lord, what shall he then fear?
There are two types of anger (krodha), one of which debases the
mind while the other leads to spiritual growth. The root of the first is
pride, which makes one angry when slighted. This prevents the mind
from seeing things in perspective and makes one's judgement defective.
The yogi, on the other hand, is angry with himself when his mind
stoops low or when all his learning and experience fail to stop him
from folly. He is stern with himself when he deals with his own faults,
but gentle with the faults of others. Gentleness of mind is an attribute
of a yogi, whose heart melts at all suffering. In him gentleness for others
and firmness for himself go hand in hand, and in his presence all
hostilities are given up.

Satya. Satya or truth is the highest rule of conduct or morality.

,
Mahatma Gandhi said: 'Truth is God and God is Truth. As fire burns
impurities and refines gold, so the fire of truth cleanses the yogi and
burns up the dross in him.
If the mind thinks thoughts of truth, if the tongue speaks words
of truth and if the whole life is. based upon truth, then one becomes fit
for union with the Infinite. Reality in its fundamental nature is love
and truth and expresses itself through these two aspects. The yogi's
life must conform strictly to these two facets of Reality. That is why
ahimsa, which is essentially based on love, is enjoined. Satya pre­
supposes perfect truthfulness in thought, word and deed. Untruthful­
ness in any form puts the sadhaka out of harmony with the funda­
mental law of truth.
Truth is not limited to speech alone. There are four sins of speech:
abuse and obscenity, dealing in falsehoods, calumny or telling tales
and lastly ridiculing what others hold to be sacred. The tale bearer
is more poisonous than a snake. The control of speech leads to the

34

Light on Yoga

rooting out of malice. When the mind bears malice towards none, it is
filled with charity towards all. He who has learnt to control his tongue
has attained self-control in a great measure. When such a person
speaks he will be heard with respect and attention. His words will be
remembered, for they will be good and true.
When one who is established in truth prays with a pure heart, then
things he really needs come to him when they are really needed: he
does not have to run after them. The man firmly established in truth
gets the fruit of his actions without a!'parently doing anything. God,
the source of all truth, supplies his needs and looks after his welfare.
Asteya. The desire to possess and enjoy what another has, drives a

person to do evil deeds. From this desire spring the urge to steal and
the urge to covet. Asteya (a = not, steya=stealing), or non-stealing
includes not only taking what belongs to another without permission,
but also using something for a different purpose to that intended, or
beyond the time permitted by its owner. It thus includes misappropria­
tion, breach of trust, mismanagement and misuse. The yogi reduces
his physical needs to the minimum, believing that if he gathers things
he does not really need, he is a thief. While other men crave for wealth,
power, fame or enjoyment, the yogi has one craving and that is to adore
the Lord. Freedom from craving enables one to ward off great tempta­
tions. Craving muddies the stream of tranquillity. It makes men base
and vile and cripples them. He who obeys the commandment Thou
shalt not steal, becomes a trusted repository of all treasures.
Brahmacharya. According to the dictionary brahmacharya means the

life of celibacy, religious study and self-restraint. It is thought that
the loss of semen leads to death and its retention to life. By the
preservation of semen the yogi's body develops a sweet smell. So long
as it is retained, there is no fear of death. Hence the injunction that it
should be preserved by concentrated effort of the mind. The concept
of brahmacharya is not one of negation, forced austerity and prohibi­
tion. According to Sankaracharya, a brahmachar1 (one who observes
brahmacharya) is a man who is engrossed in the study of the sacred
Vedic lore, constantly moves in Brahman and knows that all exists in
Brahman. In other words, one who sees divinity in all is a
brahmacharl. Pataiijali, however, lays stress on continence of the body,
speech and mind. This does not mean that the philosophy of Yoga is
meant only for celibates. Brahmacharya has little to do with whether
one is a bachelor or married and living the life of a householder. One
has to translate the higher aspects of Brahmacharya in one's daily living.
It is not necessary for one's salvation to stay unmarried and without

Introduction

35

a house. On the contrary, all the sm�tls (codes of law) recommend
marriage. Without experiencing human love and happiness, it is not
possible to know divine love. Almost all the yogis and sages of old in
India were married men with families of their own. They did not
shirk their social or moral responsibilities. Marriage and parenthood
are no bar to the knowledge of divine love, happiness and union with
the Supreme Soul.
Dealing with the position of an aspirant who is a householder, the
Siva Samhita says: Let him practise free from the company of men in
a retired place. For the sake of appearances, he should remain in
society, but not have his heart in it. He should not renounce the duties
of his profession, caste or rank; but let him perform these as an instru­
ment of the Lord, without any thought of the results. He succeeds
by following wisely the method of Yoga; there is no doubt of it. Remain­
ing in the midst of the family, always doing the duties of the house­
holder, he who is free from merits and demerits and has restrained
his senses, attains salvation. The householder practising Yoga is not
touched by virtue or vice; if to protect mankind he commits any sin,
he is not polluted by it. (Chapter V, verses 234-8.)
When one is established in brahmacharya, one develops a fund of
vitality and energy, a courageous mind and a powerful intellect so
that one can fight any type of injustice. The brahmacharl will use the
forces he generates wisely: he will utilise the physical ones for doing
the work of the Lord, the mental for the spread of culture and the
intellectual for the growth of spiritual life. Brahmacharya is the battery
that sparks the torch of wisdom.
Aparigraha. Parigraha means hoarding or collecting. To be free from
hoarding is aparigraha. It is thus but another facet of asteya (non­
stealing). Just as one should not take things one does not really need,
so one should not hoard or collect things one does not require im­
mediately. Neither should one take anything without working for it
or as a favour from another, for this indicates poverty of spirit. The
yogi feels that the collection or hoarding of things implies a lack of
faith in God and in himself to provide for his future. He keeps faith
by keeping before him the image of the moon. During the dark half of
the month, the moon rises late when most men are asleep and so
do not appreciate its beauty. Its splendour wanes but it does not stray
from its path and is indifferent to man's lack of appreciation. It has
faith that it will be full again when it faces the Sun and then men
will eagerly await its glorious rising.
By the observance of aparigraha, the yogi makes his life as simple
as possible and trains his mind not to feel the loss or the lack of any-

36

·

Light on Yoga

thing. Then everything he really needs will come to him by itself at the
proper time. The life of an ordinary man is filled with an unending
series of disturbances and frustrations and with his reactions to them.
Thus there is hardly any possibility of keeping the mind in a state of
equilibrium. The sadhaka has developed the capacity to remain satisfied
with whatever happens to him. Thus he obtains the peace which takes
him beyond the realms of illusion and misery with which our world
is saturated. He recalls the promise given by Sri Krishna to Arjuna
in the ninth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita : 'To those who worship
Me alone with single-minded devotion, who are in harmony with Me
every moment, I bring full security. I shall supply all their wants and
shall protect them for ever.'
,

Niyama
Niyama are the rules of conduct that apply to individual discipline,
while yama are universal in their application. The five niyama listed
by Pataiijali are: saucha (purity), santo�a (contentment), tapas (ardour
or austerity), svadhyaya (study of the Self) and ISvara pranidhana
(dedication to the Lord).
Saucha. Purity of body is essential for well-being. While good habits
like bathing purify the body externally, asana and prii!.fiiyama cleanse
it internally. The practice of asanas tones the entire body and removes
the toxins and impurities caused by over-indulgence. Prii!.fiiyama
cleanses and aerates the lungs, oxygenates the blood and purifies the
nerves. But more important than the physical cleansing of the body
is the cleansing of the mind of its disturbing emotions like hatred,
passion, anger, lust, greed, delusion and pride. Still more important
is the cleansing of the intellect (buddhi) of impure thoughts. The
impurities of the mind are washed off in the waters of bhakti
(adoration). The impurities of the intellect or reason are burned off
in the fire of svadhyaya (study of the Self). This internal cleansing
gives radiance and joy. It brings benevolence (saumanasya) and banishes
mental pain, dejection, sorrow and despair (daurmanasya). When one
is benevolent, one sees the virtues in others and not merely their faults.
The respect which one shows for another's virtues, makes him self­
respecting as well and helps him to fight his own sorrows and dif­
ficulties. When the mind is lucid, it is easy to make it one-pointed
(ekagra). With concentration, one obtains mastery over the senses
(indriya-jaya). Then one is ready to enter the temple of his own body
and see his real self in the mirror of his mind.
Besides purity of body, thought and word, pure food is also neces­
sary. Apart from cleanliness in the preparation of food it is also

Introduction

37

necessary to observe purity m the means by which one procures
it.
Food, the supporting yet consuming substance of all life, is regarded
as a phase of Brahman. I t should be eaten with th.e feeling that with
each morsel one can gain strength to serve the Lord. Then food
becomes pure. Whether or not to be a vegetarian is a purely personal
matter as each person is influenced by the tradition and habits of the
country in which he was born and bred. But, in course of time, the
practitioner of yoga has to adopt a vegetarian diet, in order to attain
one-pointed attention and spiritual evolution.
Food should be taken to promote health, strength, energy and life.
I t should be simple, nourishing, juicy and soothing. Avoid foods which
are sour, bitter, salty, pungent, burning, stale, tasteless, heavy and
unclean.
Character is moulded by the type of food we take and by how we
eat it. Men are the only creatures that eat when not hungry and
generally live to eat rather than eat to live. If we eat for flavours of
the tongue, we over-eat and so suffer from digestive disorders which
throw our systems out of gear. The yogi believes in harmony, so he
eats for the sake of sustenance only. H e does not eat too much or too
little. He looks upon his body as the rest-house of his spirit and
guards himself against over-indulgence.
Besides food, the place is also important for spiritual practices. It is
difficult to practise in a distant country (away from home), in a forest,
in a crowded city, or where it is noisy. One should choose a place
where food is easily procurable, a place which is free from insects,
protected from the elements and with pleasing surroundings. The banks
of a lake or river or the sea-shore are ideal. Such quiet ideal places
are hard to find in modern times; but one can at least make a corner
in one's room available for practice and keep it clean, airy, dry and
pest-free.
Santosa.
. Santosa
. or contentment has to be cultivated. A mind that is
not content cannot concentrate. The yogi feels the lack of nothing and
so he is naturally content. Contentment gives bliss unsurpassed to the
yogi. A contented man is complete for he has known the love of the
Lord and has done his duty. He is blessed for he has known truth
and joy.
Contentment and tranquillity are states of mind. Differences arise
among men because of race, creed, wealth and learning. Differences
create discord and there arise conscious or unconscious conflicts which
distract and perplex one. Then the mind cannot become one-pointed
(ekagra) and is robbed of its peace. There is contentment and tranquillity

38

Light on Yoga

when the flame of the spirit does not waver in the wind of desire.
The sadhaka does not seek the empty peace of the dead, but the peace
of one whose reason is firmly established in God.
Tapas. Tapas is derived from the root 'tap' meaning to blaze, bum,
shine, suffer pain or consume by heat. It therefore means a burning
effort under all circumstances to achieve a definite goal in life. It involves
purification, self-discipline and austerity. The whole science of char­
acter building may be regarded as a practice of tapas.
Tapas is the conscious effort to achieve ultimate union with the
Divine and to burn up all desires which stand in the way of this goal.
A worthy aim makes life illumined, pure and divine. Without such
an aim, action and prayer have no value. Life without tapas, is like
a heart without love. Without tapas, the mind cannot reach up to the
Lord.
Tapas is of three types. It may relate to the body (kayika), to speech
(vachika) or to mind (manasika). Continence (brahmacharya) and non­
violence (ahimsa) are tapas of the body. Using words which do not
offend, reciting the glory of God, speaking the truth without regard
for the consequences to oneself and not speaking ill of others are tapas
of speech. Developing a mental attitude whereby one remains tranquil
and balanced in joy and sorrow and retains self-control are tapas of
the mind.
It is tapas when one works without any selfish motive or hope of
reward and with an unshakable faith that not even a blade of grass can
move without His will.
By tapas the yogi develops strength in body, mind and character.
He gains courage and wisdom, integrity, straightforwardness and
simplicity.
Svadhyaya. Sva means self and adhyaya means study or education.
Education is the drawing out of the best that is within a person.
Svadhyaya, therefore, is the education of the self.
Svadhyaya is different from mere instruction like attending a lecture
where the lecturer parades his own learning before the ignorance of
his audience. When people meet for svadhyaya, the speaker and listener
are of one mind and have mutual love and respect. There is no sermonis­
ing and one heart speaks to another. The ennobling thoughts that arise
from svadhyaya are, so to speak, taken into one's bloodstream so that
they become a part of one's life and being.
The person practising svadhyaya reads his own book of life, at the
same time that he writes and revises it. There is a change in his out­
look on life. He starts to realise that all creation is meant for bhakti

(rdoration) rather than for bhoga (enjoyment), that all creation is
divine, that there is divinity within himself and that the energy which
moves him is the same that moves the entire universe.
According to Sri Vinoba Bhave (the leader of the Bhoodan move­
ment), svadhyaya is the study of one subject which is the basis or root
of all other subjects or actions, upon which the others rest, but which
itself does not rest upon anything.
To make life healthy, happy and peaceful, it is essential to study
regularly divine literature in a pure place. This study of the sacred
books of the world will enable the sadhaka to concentrate upon and
solve the difficult problems of life when they arise. It will put an end
to ignorance and bring knowledge. Ignorance has no beginning, but
it has an end. There is a beginning but no end to knowledge. By
svadhyaya the sadhaka understands the nature of his soul and gains
communion with the divine. The sacred books of the world are for all
to read. They are not meant for the members of one particular faith
alone. As bees savour the nectar in various flowers, so the sadhaka
absorbs things in other faiths which will enable him to appreciate his
own faith better.
Philology is not a language but the science of languages, the study
of which will enable the student to learn his own language better.
Similarly, Yoga is not a religion by itself. It is the science of religions,
the study of which will enable a sadhaka the better to appreciate his
own faith.

ISvara praJ?.idhana. He who has faith in God does not despair. He has
illumination (tejas). He who knows that all creation belongs to the
Lord will not be puffed up with pride or drunk with power. He will
not stoop for selfish purposes; his head will bow only in worship.
When the waters of bhakti (adoration) are made to flow through the
turbines of the mind, the result is mental power and spiritual illumina­
tion. While mere physical strength without bhakti · is lethal, mere
adoration without strength of character is like an opiate. Addiction to
pleasures destroys both power and glory. From the gratification of the
senses as they run after pleasures arise moha (attachment) and lobha
(greed) for their repetition. If the senses are not gratified, then, there
is soka (sorrow). They have to be curbed with knowledge and forbear­
ance; but to control the mind is more difficult. After one has exhausted
one's own resources and still not succeeded, one turns to the Lord for
help for He is the source of all power. It is at this stage that bhakti
begins. In bhakti, the mind, the intellect and the will are surrendered
to the Lord and the sadhaka prays : 'I do not know what is good for

40

Light on Yoga

me. Thy will be done.' Others pray to have their own desires gratified
or accomplished. In bhakti or true love there is no place for ' I ' and
'mine'. When the feeling of 'I' and 'mine' disappears, the individual
soul has reached full growth.
When the mind has been emptied of desires of personal gratifica­
tion, it should be filled with thoughts of the Lord. In a mind filled
with thoughts of personal gratification, there is danger of the senses
dragging the mind after the objects of desire. Attempts to practise
bhakti without emptying the mind of desires is like building a fire
with wet fuel. It makes a lot of smoke and brings tears to the eyes of
the person who builds it and of those around him. A mind with desires
does not ignite and glow, nor does it generate light and warmth when
touched with ti�e fire of knowledge.
The name of the Lord is like the Sun, dispelling all darkness. The
moon is full when it faces the sun. The individual soul experiences
fullness (piir�ata) when it faces the Lord. If the shadow of the earth
comes between the full moon and the sun there is an eclipse. If the
feeling of 'I' and 'mine' casts its shadow upon the experience of full­
ness, all efforts of the sadhaka to gain peace are futile.
Actions mirror a man's personality better than his words. The yogi
has learnt the art of dedicating all his actions to the Lord and so
they reflect the divinity within him.
Asana
The third limb of yoga is asana or posture. Asana brings steadiness,
health and lightness of limb. A steady and pleasant po�ture produces
mental equilibrium and prevents fickleness of mind. Asanas are not
merely gymnastic exercises; they are postures. To perform them one
needs a clean airy place, a blanket and determination, while for other
systems of physical training one needs large playing fields and costly
equipment. Asanas can be done alone, as the limbs of the body pro­
vide the necessary weights and counter-weights. By practising them
on� develops agility, balance, endurance and great vitality.
Asanas have been evolved over the centuries so as to exercise every
muscle, nerve and gland in the body. They secure a fine physique,
which is strong and elastic without being muscle-bound and they keep
the body free from disease. They reduce fatigue and soothe the nerves.
But their real importance lies in the way they train and discipline the
mind.
Many actors, acrobats, athletes, dancers, musicians and sports­
men also possess superb physiques and have great control over the
body, but they lack control over the mind, the intellect and the Self.
Hence they are in disharmony with themselves and one rarely comes

Introduction

41

across a balanced personality among them. They often put the body
above all else. Though the yogi does not underrate his body, he does
not think merely of its perfection but of his senses, mind, intellect and
soul.
The yogi conquers the body by the practice of asanas and makes it
a fit vehicle for the spirit. He knows that it is a necessary vehicle
for the spirit. A soul without a body is like a bird deprived of its
power to fly.
The yogi does not fear death, for time must take its toll of all flesh.
He knows that the body is constantly changing and is affected by
childhood, youth and old age. Birth and death are natural phenomena
but the soul is not subject to birth and death. As a man casting off
worn-out garments takes on new ones, so the dweller within the body
casting aside worn-out bodies enters into others that are new.
The yogi believes that his body has been given to him by the Lord
not for enjoyment alone, but also for the service of his fellow men
during every wakeful moment of his life. He does not consider it his
property. He knows that the Lord who has given him his body will one
day take it away.
By performing asanas, the sadhaka first gains health, which is not
mere existence. I t is not a commodity which can be purchased with
money. It is an asset to be gained by sheer hard work. It is a state of
complete equilibrium of body, mind and spirit. Forgetfulness of
physical and mental consciousness is health. The yogi frees himself
from physical disabilities and mental distractions by practising asanas.
He surrenders his actions and their fruits to the Lord in the service
of the world.
The yogi realises that his life and all its activities are part of the
divine action in nature, manifesting and operating in the form of man.
In the beating of his pulse and the rhythm of his respiration, he
recognises the flow of the seasons and the throbbing of universal life.
His body is a temple which houses the Divine Spark. He feels that to
neglect or to deny the needs of the body and to think of it as some­
thing not divine, is to neglect and deny the universal life of which it
is a part. The needs of the body are the needs of the divine spirit
which lives through the body. The yogi does not look heaven-ward
to find God for he knows that He is within, being known as the
Antaratma (the Inner Self). He feels the kingdom of God within and
without and finds that heaven lies in himself.
Where does the body end and the mind begin? Where does the
mind end and the spirit begin? They cannot be divided as they are
inter-related and but different aspects of the same all-pervading divine
consciousness.

42

Light on Yoga

The yogi never neglects or mortifies the body or the mind, but
cherishes both. To him the body is not an impediment to his spiritual
liberation nor is it the cause of its fall, but is an instrument of attain­
ment. He seeks a body strong as a thunderbolt, healthy and free from
suffering so as to dedicate it in the service of the Lord for which it is
intended. As pointed out in the Mu1J4akopani�ad the Self cannot be
attained by one without strength, nor through heedlessness, nor without
an aim. Just as an unbaked earthen pot dissolves in water the body soon
decays. So bake it hard in the fire of yogic discipline in order to
strengthen and purify it.
The names of the asanas are significant and illustrate the principle
of evolution. Some are named after vegetation like the tree (vrk�a) and
the lotus (padma) ; some after insects l.ike the locust (salabha) and the
scorpion (vrschika) ; some after aquatic animals and amphibians like
the fish (matsya), the tortoise (kiirma), the frog (bheka or max:>-9iika) or
the crocodile (nakra). There are asanas called after birds like the cock
(kukku�a), the heron (baka), the peacock (mayiira) and the swan
(harilsa). They are also named after quadrupeds like the dog (svana),
the horse (vatayana), the camel (u��ra) and the lion (sirilha). Creatures
that crawl like the serpent (bhujailga) are not forgotten, nor is the
human embryonic state (garbha-pinda) overlooked. Asanas are named
after legendary heroes like Vfrabhadra and Hanuman, son of the Wind.
'ages like Bharadvaja, Kapila, Vasigha and Visvamitra are remembered
y having asanas named after them. Some asanas are also called after
ods of the Hindu pantheon and some recall the Avataras, or incarna­
.ons of Divine Power. Whilst performing asanas the yogi's body
assum..!S many forms resembling a variety of creatures. His mind is
trained not to despise any creature, for he knows that throughout the
whole gamut of creation, from the lowliest insect to the most perfect
sage, there breathes the same Universal Spirit, which assumes innumer­
able forms. He knows that the highest form is that of the Formless.
He finds unity in universality. True asana is that in which the thought
of Brahman flows effortlessly and incessantly through the mind of the
sadhaka.
Dualities like gain and loss, victory and defeat, fame and shame,
body and mind, mind and soul vanish through mastery of the asanas,
and the sadhaka then passes on to prfu}ayama, the fourth stage in the
path of yoga. In prfu}ayama practices the nostrils, nasal passages and
membranes, the windpipe, the lungs and the diaphragm are the only
parts of the body which are actively involved. These alone feel the
full impact of the force of prax:>-a, the breath of life. Therefore, do p.ot
seek to master prax:>-ayama in a hurry, as you are playing with life itself.
By its improper practice respiratory diseases will arise and the nervous

Introduction

43

system will be shattered. By its proper practice one is freed from most
diseases. Never attempt to practise pra�ayama alone by yourself. For it
is essential to have the personal supervision of a Guru who knows the
physical limitations of his pupil.

PrarJayama
Just as the word yoga is one of wide import, so also is praJ).a. Pral).a
means breath, respiration, life, vitality, wind, energy or strength. I t
also connotes the soul as opposed to the body. The word is generally
used in the plural to indicate vital breaths . Ayama means length,
expansion, stretching or restraint. Pral).ayama thus connotes extension
of breath and its control. This control is over all the functions of
breathing, namely, (I) inhalation or inspiration, which is termed
piiraka (filling up); ( 2) exhalation or expiration, which is called rechaka
(emptying the lungs), and (3) retention or holding the breath, a state
where there is no inhalation or exhalation, which is termed
kumbhaka. In Ha�ha Yoga texts kumbhaka is also used in a loose
generic sense to include all the three respiratory processes of inhala­
tion, exhalation and retention.
A kumbha is a pitcher, water pot, jar or chalice. A water pot may
be emptied of all air and filled completely with water, or it may be
emptied of all water and filled completely with air. Similarly, there
are two states of kumbhaka namely (I) when breathing is suspended
after full inhalation (the lungs being completely filled with life­
giving air), and (2) when breathing is suspended after full exhalation
(the lungs being emptied of all noxious air). The first of these states,
where breath is held after a full inhalation, but before exhalation be­
gins, is known as antara kumbhaka. The second, where breath is held
after a full exhalation, but before inhalation begins is known as bahya
kumbhaka. Antara means inner or interior, while bahya means outer or
exterior. Thus, kumbhaka is the interval or intermediate time between
full inhalation and exhalation (antara kumbhaka) or between full exhala­
tion and inhalation (bahya kumbhaka). In both these types breathing is
suspended and restrained.
Pral).ayama is thus the science of breath. It is the hub round which
the wheel of life revolves. 'As lions, elephants and tigers are tamed very
slowly and cautiously, so should pr�a be brought under control very
slowly in gradation measured according to one's capacity and physical

limitations. Otherwise it will kill the practitioner,' warns the Hafha
Yoga Pradipika (chapter I I , verse I6).
The yogi's life is not measured by the number of his days but by the
number of his breaths. Therefore, he follows the proper rhythmic
patterns of slow deep breathing. These rhythmic patterns strengthen

44

Light on Yoga

the respiratory system, soothe the nervous system and reduce craving.
As desires and cravings diminish, the mind is set free and becomes a
fit vehicle for concentration. By improper practice of pra:r:tayama the
pupil introduces several disorders into his system like hiccough, wind,
asthma, cough, catarrh, pains in the head, eyes and ears and nervous
irritation. I t takes a long time to learn slow, deep, steady and proper

inhalations and exhalations. Master this before attempting kumbhaka.
As a fire blazes brightly when the covering of ash over it is scattered
by the wind, the divine fire within the body shines in all its majesty
when the ashes of desire are scattered by the practice of prat;tayama.
'The emptying the mind of the whole 9f its illusion is the true rechaka
(exhalation). The realisation that " I am Atma (spirit), is the true piiraka
(inhalation). And the steady sustenance of the mind on this conviction
is the true kumbhaka (retention). This is true pranayama,'
says
.
'

Sankaracharya.
Every living creature unconsciously breathes the prayer 'So'ham'
(S�= He: Aham= I - He, the Immortal Spirit, am I ) with each inward
breath. So also with each outgoing breath each creature prays 'HarilsaJ:l'
( I am He). This ajapa-mantra (unconscious repetitive prayer) goes on
for ever within each living creature throughout life. The yogi fully
realises the significance of this ajapa-mantra and so is released from all
the fetters that bind his soul. He offers up the very breath of his being
to the Lord as a sacrifice and receives the breath of life from the Lord
as his blessing.
Pra:r:ta in the body of the individual (j1vatma) is part of the cosmic
breath of the Universal Spirit (Paramatma) . An attempt is made to
harmonise the individual breath (pi:t:J.�a-pra:r:ta) with the cosmic breath
(Brahma:r:t9a-pra:r:ta) through the practice of pra:t:J.ayama.
I t has been said by Kariba Ekken, a seventeenth-century mystic ; 'If
you would foster a calm spirit, first regulate your breathing; for when
that is under control, the heart will be at peace; but when breathing is
spasmodic, then it will be troubled. Therefore, before attempting any­
thing, first regulate your breathing on which your temper will be
softened, your spirit calmed.'
The chitta (mind, reason and ego) is like a chariot yoked to a team of
powerful horses. One of them is pra:r:ta (breath), the other is vasana
(desire). The chariot moves in the direction of the more powerful
animal. If breath prevails, the desires are controlled, the senses are held
in check and the mind is stilled. If desire prevails, breath is in disarray
and the mind is agitated and troubled. Therefore, the yogi masters the
science of breath and by the regulation and control of breath, he controls
the mind and stills its constant movement. In the practice of pra:r:tayama
the eyes are kept shut to prevent the mind from wandering. 'When the

Introduction

45

praJ?a and the manas (mind) have been absorbed, an undefinable joy
ensues.' (Hafha Yoga Pradfpikii, chapter IV, verse 30.)
Emotional excitement affects the rate of breathing; equally, deliberate
regulation of breathing checks emotional excitement. As the very object
of Yoga is to control and still the mind, the yogi first learns pranayama
to master the breath. This will enable him to control the senses and so
reach the stage of pratyahara. Only then will the mind be ready for
concentration (dhyana).
The mind is said to be twofold -pure and impure. It is pure when it
is completely free from desires and impure when it is in union with
desires. By making the mind motionless and freeing it from sloth and
distractions, one reaches the state of mindlessness (amanaska), which is
the supreme state of samadhi. This state of mindlessness is not lunacy
or idiocy but the conscious state of the mind when it is free from
thoughts and desires. There is a vital difference between an idiot or a
lunatic on the one hand, and a yogi striving to achieve a state of mindless­
ness on the other. The former is careless ; the latter attempts to be
carefree. It is the oneness of the breath and mind and so also of the senses
and the abandonment of all conditions of existence and thought that is
designated Yoga.

PriirJa Viiyu. One of the most subtle forms of energy is air. This vital

energy which also pervades the human body is classified in five main
categories in the Ha�ha Yoga texts according to the various functions
performed by the energy. These are termed vayu (wind) and the five
main divisions are: prat:ta (here the generic term is used to designate the
particular), which moves in the region of the heart and controls respira­
tion; apana, which moves in the sphere of the lower abdomen and
controls the function of eliminating urine and faeces ; samana, which
stokes the gastric fires to aid digestion; udana, which dwells in the
thoracic cavity and controls the intake of air and food ; and vyana, which
pervades the entire body and distributes the energy derived from food
and breath. There are also five subsidiary vayiis. These are: naga, which
relieves abdominal pressure by belching ; kiirma, which controls the
movements of the eyelids to prevent foreign matter or too bright a light
entering the eyes ; k�kara, which prevents substances passing up the
nasal passages and down the throat by making one sneeze or cough;
devadatta, which provides for the intake of extra oxygen in a tired body
by causing a yawn, and lastly dhanariljaya, which remains in the body
even after death and sometimes bloats up a corpse.

Pracyahara
If a man's reason succumbs to the pull of his senses he is lost. On the

46

Light on Yoga

other hand, if there is rhythmic control of breath, the senses instead of
running after external objects of desire turn inwards, and man is set

free from their tyranny. This is the fifth stage of Yoga, namely,
pratyahara, where the senses are brought under control.
When this stage is reached, the sadhaka goes through a searching self­
examination. To overcome the deadly but attractive spell of sensual
objects, he needs the insulation of adoration (bhakti) by recalling to his
mind the Creator who made the objects of his desire. He also needs
the lamp of knowledge of his divine heritage. The mind, in truth, is for
mankind the cause of bondage and liberation; it brings bondage if it is
bound to the objects of desire and liberation when it is free from objects.
There is bondage when the mind craves, grieves or is unhappy over
something. The mind becomes pure when all desires and fears are
annihilated. Both the good and the pleasant present themselves to men
and prompt them to action. The yogi prefers the good to the pleasant.
Others driven by their desires, prefer the pleasant to the good and miss
the very purpose of life. The yogi feels joy in what he is. He knows how

to stop and, therefore, lives in peace. At first he prefers that which is
bitter as poison, but he perseveres in his practice knowing well that in
the end it will become as sweet as nectar. Others hankering for the union
of their senses with the objects of their desires, prefer that which at first
seems sweet as nectar, but do not know that in the end it will be as bitter
as pOison.
The yogi knows that the path towards satisfaction of the senses by
sensual desires is broad, but that it leads to destruction and that there
are many who follow it. The path of Yoga is like the sharp edge of a
razor, narrow and difficult to tread, and there are few who find it. The
yogi knows that the paths of ruin or of salvation lie within himself.
According to Hindu philosophy, consciousness manifests in three
different qualities. For man, his life and his consciousness, together with
the entire cosmos are the emanations of one and the same prakrti
(cosmic matter or substance) - emanations that differ in designation
through the predominance of one of the gu!fas. These gu!faS (qualities or
attributes) are:

1 . Sattva (the illuminating, pure or good quality), which leads to clarity

and mental serenity.
2. Rajas (the quality of mobility or activity), which makes a person
active and energetic, tense and wilful, and
3· Tamas (the dark and restraining quality), which obstructs and
counteracts the tendency of rajas to work and of sattva to reveal.
Tamas is a quality of delusion, obscurity, inertia and ignorance. A
person in whom it predominates is inert and plunged in a state of torpor.

Introduction- 47
The quality of sattva leads towards the divine and tamas towards the
demonic, while in between these two stands rajas.
The faith held, the food consumed, the sacrifices performed, the
austerities undergone and the gifts given by each individual vary in
accordance with his predominating g�a.
He that is born with tendencies towards the divine is fearless and pure.
He is generous and self-controlled. He pursues the study of the Self. He
is non-violent, truthful and free from anger. He renounces the fruits of
his labour, working only for the sake of work. He has a tranquil mind,
with malice towards none and charity towards all, for he is free from
craving. He is gentle, modest and steady. He is illumined, clement and
resolute, being free from perfidy and pride.
A man in whom raj6-gur:ta predominates has inner thirst and is
affectionate. As he is passionate and covetous, he hurts others. Being full
of lust and hatred, envy and deceit, his desires are insatiable. He is
unsteady, fickle and easily distracted as well as ambitious and acquisi­
tive. He seeks the patronage of friends and has family pride. He shrinks
from unpleasant things and clings to pleasant ones. His speech is sour
and his stomach greedy.
He that is born with demonic tendencies is deceitful, insolent and
conceited. He is full of wrath, cruelty and ignorance. In such people
there is neither purity, nor right conduct, nor truth. They gratify their
passions. Bewildered by numerous desires, caught in the web of
delusion, these addicts of sensual pleasures fall into hell.
The working of the mind of persons with different predominating
gunas may be illustrated by their different ways of approach towards a
universal commandment like 'Thou shalt not covet.' A man in whom
tam6-gur:ta predominates might interpret it thus : 'others should not
covet what is mine, no matter how I obtained it. If they do, I shall
destroy them.' The raj6-guna type is a calculating self-interested person
who would construe the commandment as meaning: 'I will not covet
others' goods lest they covet mine.' He will follow the letter of the law
as a matter of policy, but not the true spirit of the law as a matter of
principle. A person of sattvika temperament will follow both the letter
and the spirit of the precept as a matter of principle and not of policy,
as a matter of eternal value. He will be righteous for the sake of
righteousness alone, and not because there is a human law imposing
punishment to keep him honest.
The yogi who is also human is affected by these three gur:tas. By his
constant and disciplined study (abhyasa) of himself and of the objects
which his senses tend to pursue, he learns which thoughts, words and
actions are prompted by tamas and which by rajas. With unceasing
effort he weeds out and eradicates such thoughts as are prompted by

48

Light on Yoga

tamas and he works to achieve a sattvika frame of mind. When the
sattva-gu!:fa alone remains, the human soul has advanced a long way
towards the ultimate goal.
Like unto the pull of gravity is the pull of the gunas. As intensive
research and rigorous discipline are needed to experience the wonder of
weightlessness in space, so also a searching self-examination and the
discipline fur'lished by Yoga is needed by a sadhaka to experience union
with the Creator of space when he is freed from the pull of the gu!:fas.
Once the sadhaka has experienced the fullness of creation or of the
Creator, his thirst Ctr�J:fa) for objects of sense vanishes and he looks at
them ever after with dispassion (vairagya). He experiences no disquiet
in heat or cold, in pain or pleasure, in honour or dishonour and in
virtue or vice. He treats the two imposters - triumph and disaster -with
equanimity. He has emancipated himself from these pairs of opposites.
He has passed beyond the pull of the gunas and has become a gunat'ita
(one who has transcended the gu!:fas). He is then free from birth and
death, from pain and sorrow and becomes immortal. He has no self­
identity as he lives experiencing the fullness of the Universal Soul. Such
a man, scorning nothing, leads all things to the path of perfection.
.

.

Dharana
.
When the body has been tempered by asanas, when the mind has been
refined by the fire of pra!:fayama and when the senses have been brought
under control by pratyahara, the sadhaka reaches the sixth stage called
dhara!:fa. Here he is concentrated wholly on a single point or on a task
in which he is completely engrossed. The mind has to be stilled in order
to achieve this state of complete absorption.
The mind is an instrument which classifies, judges and co-ordinates
the impressions from the outside world and those that arise within
oneself.
Mind is the product of thoughts which are difficult to restrain for
they are subtle and fickle. A thought which is well guarded by a con­
trolled mind brings happiness. To get the best out of an instrument,
one must know how it works. The mind is the instrument for thinking
and it is therefore necessary to consider how it functions. Mental states
are classified in five groups. The first of these is the k�ipta state, where
the mental forces are scattered, being in disarray and in a state of
neglect. Here the mind hankers after objects, the rago-guJ;Ia being
dominant. The second is the vik�ipta state, where the mind is agitated
and distracted. Here there is a capacity to enjoy the fruits of one's efforts,
but the desires are not marshalled and controlled. Then in the miidha
state the mind is foolish, dull and stupid. It is confounded and at a loss
to know what it wants and here the tamo-guna predominates. The fourth

Introduction

49

state of the mind is the ekagra (eka = one; agra = foremost) state, where
the mind is closely attentive and the mental faculties are concentrated
on a single object or focussed on one point only, with the sattva-g�a
prevailing. The ekagra person has superior intellectual powers and
knows exactly what he wants, so he uses all his powers to achieve his
purpose. At times the ruthless pursuit of the desired object, irrespective
of the cost to others, can create great misery, and it often happens that
even if the desired object is achieved it leaves behind a bitter taste.
Arjuna, the mighty bowman of the epic Mahabharata, provides us
with an example of what is meant by dharapa. Once Dro�a, the preceptor
of the royal princes, organised an archery contest to test their pro­
ficiency. They were called upon one by one to describe the target, which
was pointed out to them. I t was a nesting bird. Some princes described
the grove of trees, others the particular tree or the bough on which the
nest stood. When Arjuna's tum came, he described first the bird. Then
he saw only its head, and lastly he could see nothing but the shining eye
of the bird, which was the centre of the target chosen by Dro�a.
There is danger, however, of an ekagra person becoming supremely
egotistical. Where the senses start roaming unchecked, the mind follows
suit. They cloud a man's judgement and set him adrift like a battered
ship on a storm-tossed sea. A ship needs ballast to keep her on an
even keel and the helmsman needs a star to steer her by. The ekagra
person needs bhakti (adoration of the Lord) and concentration on
divinity to keep his mental equilibrium so that he goes on always in
the right direction. He will not know happiness until the sense of 'I'
and 'mine' disappears.
The last mental state is that of niruddha, where the mind (manas),
intellect (buddhi) and ego (aharilkara) are all restrained and all these
faculties are offered to the Lord for His use and in His service. Here
there is no feeling of ' I ' and 'mine'. As a lens becomes more luminous
when great light is thrown upon it and seems to be all light and undis­

tinguishable from it, so also the sadhaka who has given up his mind,
intellect and ego to the Lord, becomes one with Him, for the sadhaka
thinks of nothing but Him, who is the creator of thought.
Without ekagrata or concentration one can master nothing. Without
concentration on Divinity, which shapes and controls the universe, one
cannot unlock the divinity within oneself or become a universal man.
To achieve this concentration, what is recommended is eka-tattva­
abhyasa or study of the single element that pervades all, the inmost Self
of all beings, who converts His one form into many. The sadhaka,
therefore, concentrates upon AUM, which is His symbol, to achieve
ekagrata.

•

Aum: According to Sri Vinoba Bhave, the Latin word Omne and the

Sanskrit word Aum are both derived from the same root meaning all and
both words convey the concepts of omniscience, omnipresence and
omnipotence. Another word for Aum is pra�ava, which is derived from
the root nu meaning to praise, to which is added the prefix pra denoting
superiority. The word, therefore, means the best praise or the best prayer.
The symbol AUM is composed of three syllables, namely the letters A,
u, M, and when written has a crescent and dot on its top. A few instances
of the various interpretations given to it may be mentioned here to
convey its meaning.
The letter A symbolises the conscious or waking state (jagrata­
avastha), the letter u the dream state (svapna-avastha) and the letter M
the dreamless sleep state (su�upta-avastha) of the mind and spirit. The
entire symbol, together with the crescent and the dot, stands for the

fourth state (turiya-avastha) , which combines all these states and
transcends them. This is the state of samadhi.
The letters A, u and M symbolise respectively speech (vak), the mind
(manas) and the breath oflife (pr�a), while the entire symbol stands for

the living spirit, which is but a portion of the divine spirit.
The three letters also represent the dimensions of length, breadth and
depth, while the entire symbol represents Divinity, which is beyond the
limitations of shape and form.
The three letters A, u and M symbolise the absence of desire, fear and
anger, while the whole symbol stands for the perfect man (a sthita­
prajfia), one whose wisdom is firmly established in the divine.
They represent the three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter,
while the entire symbol represents all creation together with the Creator.

They stand for the three gu�as or qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas,
while the whole symbol represents a gu�afita, one who has transcended
and gone beyond the pull of the gu�as.
The letters correspond to the three tenses- past, present and future ­
while the entire symbol stands for the Creator, who transcends the
limitations of time.
They also stand for the teaching imparted by the mother, the father
and the Guru respectively. The entire symbol represents Brahma Vidya,
the knowledge of the Self, the teaching which is imperishable.
The A, u and M depict the three stages of yogic discipline, namely,
asana, pra�ayama and pratyahara. The entire symbol represents samadhi,
the goal for which the three stages are the steps.
They represent the triad of Divinity, namely, Brahma- the creator,
Vi��u-the Maintainer, and S iva-the Destroyer of the universe. The

whole symbol is said to represent Brahman from which the universe
emanates, has its growth and fruition and into which it merges in the

end. I t does not grow or change. Many change and pass, but Brahman
is the One that ever remains unchanged.
The letters A, u and M also stand for the mantra 'Tat Twam Asi'
('That Thou Art'), the realisation of man's divinity within himself. The
entire symbol stands-for this realisation, which liberates the human spirit
from the confines of his body, mind, intellect and ego.
After realising the importance of AUM, the yogi focusses his attention
on his beloved Deity adding AUM to the name of the Lord. The word
AUM being too vast and too abstract, he unifies his senses, will, intellect,
mind and reason by focussing on the name of the Lord and adding the
word AUM with one pointed devotion and so experiences the feeling and
meaning of the mantra.
The yogi recalls the verses of the Mu1Jcfakopanifad : 'Taking as a bow
the great weapon of the Upani�ad, one should put upon it an arrow
sharpened by meditation. Stretching it with a thought directed to the
essence of That, penetrate the Imperishable as the mark1 my friend. The
mystic syllable AUM is the bow. The arrow is the Self (Atma). Brahman
is the target. By the undistracted man is It penetrated. One should come
to be in It, as the arrow in the mark.'

Dhyana
As water takes the shape of its container, the mind when it contemplates
an object is transformed into the shape of that object. The mind which
thinks of the all-pervading divinity which it worships, is ultimately
through long-continued devotion transformed into the likeness of that
divinity.
When oil is poured from one vessel to another, one can observe the
steady constant flow. When the flow of concentration is uninterrupted,
the state that arises is dhyana (meditation). As the filament in an electric
bulb glows and illumines when there is a regular uninterrupted current
of electricity, the yogi's mind will be illumined by dhyana. His body,
breath, senses, mind, reason and ego are all integrated in the object of
his contemplation- the Universal Spirit. He remains in a state of con­
sciousness which has no qualification whatsoever. There is no other
feeling except a state of SUPREME BLISS. Like a streak of lightning the
yogi sees LIGHT that shines beyond the earth and the heavens. He sees
the light that shines in his own heart. He becomes a light unto himself
and others.
The signs of progress on the path of Yoga are health, a sense of
physical lightness, steadiness, clearness of countenance and a beautiful
voice, sweetness of odour of the body and freedom from craving. He has
a balanced, serene and a tranquil mind. He is the very symbol of
humility. He dedicates all his actions to the Lord and taking refuge in

52

Light on Yoga

Him, frees himself from the bondage of karma (action) and becomes a
]Ivana Mukta (a Liberated Soul).
'What becomes of him who strives and fails to reach the end of Yoga,
who has faith, but wh_ose mind wanders away from Yoga?' To this query
of Arjuna, the Lord Sri Krishna replied:
'No evil can befall a righteous man. He dwells long years in the heaven
of those who did good, and then he is reborn in the house of the pure
and the great. He may even be born in a family of illumined yogis; but
to be born in such a family is most difficult in this world. He will regain
the wisdom attained in his former life and strives ever for perfection.
Because of his former study, practice and struggle which drive him ever
onwards, the yogi ever strives with a soul cleansed of sin, attains
perfection through many lives and reaches the supreme goal. The yogi
goes beyond those who only follow the path of austerity, knowledge or
service. Therefore, Arjuna, be thou a yogi. The greatest of all yogis is
he who adores Me with faith and whose heart abides in Me.' (Bhagavad
Gita, chapter VI, verses 38 to 47.)

Samadhi
Samadhi is the end of the sadhaka's quest. At the peak of his meditation,
he passes into the state of samadhi, where his body and senses are at rest
as if he is asleep, his faculties of mind and reason are alert as if he is
awake, yet he has gone beyond consciousness. The person in a state of
samadhi is fully conscious and alert.
All creation is Brahman. The sadhaka is tranquil and worships it as
that from which he came forth, as that in which he breathes, as that
into which he will be dissolved. The soul within the heart is smaller
than the smallest seed, yet greater than the sky, containing all works, all
desires. Into this the sadhaka enters. Then there remains no sense of 'I'
or 'mine' as the working of the body, the mind and the intellect have
stopped as if one is in deep sleep. The sadhaka has attained true Yoga;
there is only the experience of consciousness, truth and unutterable joy.
There is a peace that passeth all understanding. The mind cannot find
words to describe the state and the tongue fails to utter them. Com­
paring the experience of samadhi with other experiences, the sages say :
'Neti! Neti ! ' - ' I t is not this ! I t is not this ! ' The state can only be
expressed by profound silence. The yogi has departed from the material
world and is merged in the Eternal. There is then no duality between
the knower and the known for they are merged like camphor and the
flame.
There wells up from within the heart of the yogi the Song of the Soul.
,

-

sung by Sankaracharya in his Atma $afkam.

Introduction
Song of the Soul
I am neither ego nor reason, I am neither mind nor thought,
I cannot be heard nor cast into words, nor by smell nor sight ever caught :
In light and wind I am not found, nor yet in earth and sky­
Consciousness and joy incarnate, Bliss of the Blissful am I.
I have no name, I have no life, I breathe no vital air,
No elements have mo�lded me, no bodily sheath is my lair:
I have no speech, no hands and feet, nor means of evolution­

Consciousness and joy am I, and Bliss in dissolution.
I cast aside hatred and passion, I conquered delusion and greed;
No touch of pride caressed me, so envy never did breed:
Beyond all faiths, past reach of wealth, past freedom, past desire,
Consciousness and joy am I, and Bliss is my attire.
Virtue and vice, or pleasure and pain are not my heritage,
Nor sacred texts, nor offerings, nor prayer, nor pilgrimage :
I am neither food, nor eating, nor yet the eater am I ­
Consciousness and joy incarnate, Bliss of the Blissful am I.
I have no misgiving of death, no chasms of race divide me,
No parent ever called me child, no bond ofbirth ever tied me:
I am neither disciple nor master, I have no kin, no friend ­
Consciousness and joy am I, and merging in Bliss is my end.
Neither knowable, knowledge, nor knower am I, formless is my form,
I dwell within the senses but they are not my home:
Ever serenely balanced, I am neither free nor bound ­
Consciousness and joy am I, and Bliss is where I am found.

Technique and Effects
(After the name of each asana, there
is a number with an asterisk. These
numbers before an asterisk indicate
the intensity of the asana; the lower

higher the number, the more diffi­
cult the asana. The easiest is num­
bered 'one*', the most difficult
'sixty*'.)

Yogasanas
Hints and Cautions for t he Practice of
Asanas
The requ£sites
1 . Without firm foundations a house cannot stand. Without the practice

of the principles of yama and niyama, which lay down firm foundations
for building character, there cannot be an integrated personality. Practice
of asanas without the backing of yama and niyama is mere acrobatics.

2. The qualities demanded from an aspirant are discipline, faith, �enaci ty

and perseverance to practise regularly without interruptions.

Cleanliness andfood
3 · Before starting to practise asanas, the bladder should be emptied and

the bowels evacuated. Topsy-turvy poses help bowel movements. I f the
student is constipated or it is not possible to evacuate the bowels before
the practice of asanas, start with Slr�asana and Sarvangasana and their

variations. Attempt other asanas only after evacuation. Never practise
advanced asanas without having first evacuated the bowels.

Bath
4. Asanas come easier after taking a bath. After doing them, the body

feels sticky due to perspiration and it is desirable to bathe some fifteen
minutes later. Taking a bath or a shower both before and after practising
asanas refreshes the body and mind.

Food
5· Asanas should preferably be done on an empty stomach. If this is

difficult, a cup of tea or coffee, cocoa or milk may be taken before doing
them. They may be practised without discomfort one hour :�fter a very
light meal. Allow at least four hours to elapse after a heavy meal before
starting the practice. Food may be taken half an hour after completing
the asanas.

T£me
6. The best time to practise is either early in the morning or late in the

evening. I n the morning asanas do not come easily as the body is stiff.
The mind, however, is still fresh but its alertness and determination

58

Light on Yoga

diminish as time goes by. The stiffness of the body is conquered by
regular practice and one is able to do the asanas well. In the evening,
the body moves more freely than in the mornings, and the asanas come
better and with greater ease. Practice in the morning makes one work
better in one's vocation. I n the evening it removes the fatigue of the
day's strain and makes one fresh and calm. Difficult asanas should,
therefore, be done in the morning when one has more determination and
stimulative asanas (like Sir�asana, Sarvangasana and their variations and
Paschjmottanasana) should be practised in the evening.
'

Sun
7. Do not practise asanas after being out in the hot sun for several hours.
Place
8. They should be done in a clean airy place, free from insects and noise.
9· Do not do them on the bare floor or on an uneven place, but on a
folded blanket laid on a level floor.

Cautions
IO. No undue strain should be felt in the facial muscles, ears and eyes

or in breathing during the practice.

Closing of the eyes
I I . I n the beginning, keep the eyes open. Then you will know what

you are doing and where you go wrong. If you shut your eyes you will
not be in a position to watch the requisite movements of the body or even
the direction in which you are doing the pose. You can keep your eyes
closed only when you are perfect in a particular asana for only then will
you be able to adjust the bodily movements and feel the correct stretches.

Mirror
I2. If you are doing the asanas in front of a mirror, keep it perpendicular

to the floor and let it come down to ground level, for otherwise the poses
will look slanting due to the angle of the mirror. You will not be able
to observe the movements or placing of the head and shoulders in the
topsy-turvy poses unless the mirror reaches down to the floor.

The Brain
I3. During the practice of asanas, it is the body alone which should

be active while the brain should remain passive, watchful and alert. If
they are done with the brain, then you will not be able to see your own
mistakes.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

59

Breathing
I4. In all the asanas, the breathing should be done through the nostrils

only and not through the mouth.

I 5 · Do not restrain the breath while in the process of the asana or while

staying in it. Follow the instructions regarding breathing given in the
technique sections of the various asanas as described hereafter.
'

Savasana
I 6. After completing the practice of asanas always lie down in Savasana
for at least IO to I5 minutes, as this will remove fatigue.

Asanas and Pr0.1JO.y0.ma
•

1 7 . Read carefully the hints and cautions for the practice of pranayama
•

before attempting it (see Part Ill). Pranayama may be done either very
early in the morning before the asanas or in the evening after completing
them. I f early in the morning, pranayama may be done first for I 5 to 30
minutes: then a few minutes of S�vasana, and after allowing some time
to elapse, during which one may be engaged in normal activities, practise
asanas. If, however, these are done in the evening, allow at least half an
hour to elapse before sitting for praJ;J.ayama.

Special provisions for persons sufferingfrom dizziness or blood pressure
I 8. Do not start with S'ir�asana and Sarvangasana if you suffer from

dizziness or high blood pres�ure. First practise Paschimottanasana
Uttanasana, and Adhomukha Svanasana before attempting topsy-turvy
'

poses like S1r�asana and Sarvangasa�a and after doing these poses repeat
Paschimottanasana, Adhomukha Svanasana and Uttanasana in that
order.

I 9· All forward bending poses are beneficial for persons suffering from

either high or low blood pressure.

Special warning for persons affected by pus in the ears or displaced retina
20. Those suffering from pus in the ears or displacement of the retina
should not attempt topsy-turvy poses.

Special provisions for women
21. Menstruation: Avoid asanas during the menstrual period. But if the

flow is in excess of normal, Upavistha Konasana, Baddha Konasana,
V1rasana, Janu S1r�asana, Paschimottanasana and Uttanasana may be
performed with beneficial effect. On no account stand on your head
during the menstrual period.

Pregnancy
22. All the asanas can be practised during the first three months of
pregnancy. All the standing poses and the forward bending asanas may
be done with mild movements, for at this time the spine should be made
strong and elastic and no pressure should be felt on the abdomen.
Baddha Kol)asana and Upavigha Kol)asana may be practised through­
out pregnancy at any time of the day (even after meals, but not forward
bending immediately after meals) as these two asanas will strengthen
the pelvic muscles and the small of the back and also reduce labour pains
considerably. Pr3J)3yarna without retention (kurnbhaka) may be practised
throughout pregnancy, as regular deep breathing will help considerably
during labour.
After delivery
23. No asanas should be done during the first month after delivery.
Thereafter they may be practised mildly. Gradually increase the course
as mentioned in Appendix I . Three months after delivery all asanas may
be practised with comfort.
Effects of asanas
24. Faulty practice causes discomfort and uneasiness within a few days.
This is sufficient to show that one is going wrong. If you c�mnot nne
the fault for yourself, it is better to approach a person who h::ts practis�r:
well and get his guidance.
25. The right method of doing asanas brings lightness and an exhilarat­
ing feeling in the body as well as in the mind and a feeling of oneness of
body, mind and soul.
26. Continuous practice will change the outlook of the practiser. He
will discipline himself in food, sex, cleanliness and character and will
become a new man.
27 . When one has mastered an asana, i t comes with effortless ease and
causes no discomfort. The bodily. movements become graceful. While
performing asanas, the student's body assumes numerous forms of life
found in creation- from the lowliest insect to the most perfect sage- and
he learns that in all these there breathes the same Universal Spiri t - the
Spirit of God. He looks within himself while practising and feels the
presence of God in different asanas which he does with a sense of sur­
render unto the feet of the LORD.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

A SAN AS
I . Tacfasana (also called Samasthiti) One* (Plate 1)
Ta9a means a mountain. Sarna means upright, straight, unmoved. Sthiti
is standing still, steadiness. Ta9asana therefore implies a pose where one
stands firm and erect as a mountain. This is the basic standing pose.

I

Technique
I . Stand erect with the feet together, the heels and big toes touching
each other. Rest the heads of metatarsals on the floor and stretch all the
toes flat on the floor.
2. Tighten the knees and pull the knee-caps up, contract the hips and
pull up the muscles at the back of the thighs.

3 · Keep the stomach in, chest forward, spine stretched up and the neck
straight.

4· Do not bear the weight of the body either on the heels or the toes,
but distribute it evenly on them both.
5· Ideally in Tadasana the arms are stretched out over the head, but for
the sake of convenience, one can place them by the side of the thighs.

62

Light on Yoga

Each of the standing poses described below can then be followed easily,
starting with the pupil standing in Tadasana with palms by the side of
the thighs.
Effects
People do not pay attention to the correct method of standing. Some
stand with the body weight thrown only on one leg, or with one leg
turned completely sideways. Others bear all the weight on the heels, or
on the inner or outer edges of the feet. This can be noticed by watching
where the soles and heels of the shoes wear out. Owing to our faulty
method of standing and not distributing the body weight evenly on the
feet, we acquire specific deformities which hamper spinal elasticity.
Even if the feet are kept apart, it is better to keep the heel and toe in a
line parallel to the median plane and not at an angle. By this method,
the hips are contracted, the abdomen is pulled in and the chest is brought
forward. One feels light in body and the mind acquires agility. If we
stand with the body weight thrown only on the heels, we feel the gravity
changing; the hips become loose, the abdomen protrudes, the body
hangs back and the spine feels the strain and consequently we soon feel
fatigued and the mind becomes dull. It is therefore essential to master
the art of standing correctly.
2. Vrk�asana One* (Plate 2)
Vrksa means a tree.

Technique
1. Stand in Tac;iasana. (Plate 1)
2. Bend the right leg at the knee and place the right heel at the root of
the left thigh. Rest the foot on the left thigh, toes pointing downwards.
3· Balance on the left leg, join the palms and raise the arms straight
over the head. (Plate 2)
4· Stay for a few seconds in the pose breathing deeply. Then lower the
arms and separate the palms, straighten the right leg and stand again in
Tadasana
.
.
5· Repeat the pose, standing on the right leg, placing the left heel at the
root of the right thigh. Stay for the same length of time on both sides,
come back to Tac;iasana (Plate I) and relax.
Effects
The pose tones the leg muscles and gives one a sense of balance and
p01se.

3· Uttihita TrikorJiisana Three* (Plates 4 and 5)
Uttihita means extended, stretched. Trikona
. (tri = three ; kona = angle)
is a triangle. This standing asana is the extended triangle pose.
.

Technique
I . Stand in Ta�asana. (Plate 1 )

2. Inhale deeply and with a jump spread apart the legs sideways 3 to
3! feet. Raise the arms sideways, in line with the shoulders, palms facing
down. Keep the arms parallel to the floor. (Plate 3)
3· Turn the right foot sideways 90 degrees to the right. Turn the left
foot slightly to the right, keeping the left leg stretched from the inside
and tightened at the knee.
4. Exhale, bend the trunk sideways to the right, bringing the right palm
near the right ankle. If possible, the right palm should rest completely
on the floor. (Plates 4 and 5)
5· Stretch the left arm up (as in the illustration), bringing it in line with
the right shoulder and extend the trunk. The back of the legs, the back
of the chest and the hips should be in a line. Gaze at the thumb of the

64

outstretched left hand. Keep the right knee locked tight by pulling up
the knee-cap and keep the right knee facing the toes.

6. Remain in this position from half a minute to a minute, breathing

deeply and evenly. Then lift the right palm from the floor. Inhale and
return to position 2 above.

7· Now, turn the left foot sideways 90 degrees to the left, turn the right

foot slightly to the left, keep both knees tight and continue from position
2 to 6, reversing all processes. Inhale and come to position 2. Hold the
posture for the same length of time on the left side.

8 . Exhale, and jump, coming back to Ta�asana. (Plate I)

Effects
This asana tones up the leg muscles, removes stiffness in the legs and
hips, corrects any minor deformity in the legs and allows them to develop
evenly. I t relieves backaches and neck sprains, strengthens the ankles
and develops the chest.

4· Parivr:tta TrikorJasana Five* (Plates 6 and 7)
Pariv�tta means revolved, turned round or back. Trikoifa is a triangle.
This is the revolving triangle posture. I t is a counter pose to Uttihita
TrikoJ:?.asana. (Plate 4)

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

9· Exhale, repeat the pose on the left side by turning the left foot side­
ways 90 degrees to the left and the right foot 6o degrees to the left and
place the right palm on the floor near the outer side of the left foot.
10. Stay in the pose on both sides for the same length of time, which can
be adjusted by doing, say, three to four deep respirations on each side.

I r. After completing the time, inhale, raise the trunk back to its original
position, bring the toes to the front and keep the arms as in position 1 .
12. Exhale and jump back to Tacjasana. (Plate 1.) This completes the
asana.

Effects
This asana tones the thigh, calf and hamstring muscles. The spine and
muscles of the back are also made to function properly, as the pose
increases the blood supply round the lower part of the spinal region.
The chest is expanded fully. The pose relieves pains in the back, in­
vigorates the abdominal organs and strengthens the hip muscles.
5·

Utthita PadvakorJasana Four* (Plates 8 and 9)

Parsva means side or flank. Ko�a is an angle. This is the extended lateral
angle pose.

Technique
1. Stand in Tacjasana. (Plate 1 . ) Take a deep inhalation and with a jump
spread the legs apart sideways 4 to 4i feet. Raise the arms sideways, jn
line with the shoulders, palms facing down. (Plate 3)

2. While exhaling slowly, tum the right foot sideways 90 degrees to the

right, and the left foot slightly to the right, keeping the left leg stretched
out and tightened at the knee. Bend the right leg at the knee until the
thigh and the calf form a right angle and the right thigh is parallel to the
floor.
3· Place the right palm on the floor by the side of the right foot, the right
armpit covering and touching the outer side of the right knee. Stretch
the left arm out over the left ear. Keep the head up. (Plates 8 and 9)

4· Tighten the loins and stretch the hamstrings. The chest, the hips and
the legs should be in a line and in order to achieve this, move the chest
up and back. Stretch every part of the body, concentrating on the back
portion of the whole body, specially the spine. Stretch tbe spine until
all the vertebrae and ribs move and there is a feeling that even the skin
is being stretched and pulled.

4· Exhale, and rotate the trunk and the left leg so as to bring the
left arm over the right knee. Rest the left armpit on the outer side
of the right knee, and place the left palm on the floor by the outer
side of the right foot. (Plates 10 and 1 1 )
5 · Give a good twist to the spine (to the right), turn the trunk and
bring the right arm over the right ear (as in the illustrations) and
gaze up at the outstretched right arm. Keep the left knee tight
throughout.
6. Hold this pose from half a minute to a minute, breathing deeply
and evenly. Inhale, and lift the left palm from the floor. Raise the
trunk and come back to position 2, by straightening the right leg and
raising the arms.
7· Continue with exhalation on the left side, as in positions 3 to 5,
reversing all processes.
8. In all cases where the movements are done first on one side and
then on the other the time taken should be the same in each case.
This general rule applies here.

Effects
This pose being a more intensified one than Parivrtta
Trikonasana
.
(Plate 6), has a greater effect. The hamstrings, however, are not
stretched as much as in Pariv�na Trikol)asana. The abdominal organs
are more contracted and that aids digestion. The blood circulates
well round the abdominal organs and the spinal column, and they are
thus rejuvenated. The asana helps to remove waste matter from the
colon without strain.
.

7- Virabhad'riisana I Three* (Plate 14)
Daksa
. once celebrated a great sacrifice, but he did not invite his
daughter Sat! nor her husband Siva, the chief of the gods. Sat!,
however, went to the sacrifice, but being greatly humi�iated and
insulted threw herself into the fire and perished. When Siva heard
this he was gravely provoked, tore a hair from his matted locks and
threw it to the ground. A powerful hero named Vlrabhadra rose up
and awaited his orders. He was told to lead Siva's army against
Daksa and destroy his sacrifice. Vlrabhadra and his army appeared
in the midst of Dak�a's assembly like a hurricane and destroyed the
s.acrifice, routed the other gods and priests and beheaded Dak�a.
Siva in grief for Sat! withdrew to KaiHis and plunged into meditation.
Sat! was born again as U:ma in the house of Himalaya. She strove
once more for the love of Siva and ultimately won his heart. The story

6. Hold in this pose from 20 to 30 seconds, with deep and even
breathing.
7· While balancing, the whole body (except the right leg) is to be
kept parallel to the floor. The right leg, which should be fully
stretched and stiff, should be kept perpendicular to the floor. Pull
the back of the right thigh and stre tch the arms and the left leg as if
two persons are pulling you from either end.
8. Exhale and come back to V!rabhaddisana I . (Plate 14)

9· Repeat the pose on the left side.
Effects
The illustration (Plate 17) conveys the harmony, balance, poise and
power attained by practising this as ana. It helps to contract and tone
the abdominal organs and makes the leg muscles more shapely and
sturdy. I t is recommended for runners, as it gives vigour and agility.
All the movements of this asana improve one's bearing and
carriage. When we stand badly, by throwing the weight on the heels,
we retard symmetrical growth and hamper spinal elasticity. Standing
with the weight on the heels causes the stomach to protrude and
lessens bodily and mental agility. This asana helps one to stand firmly
on the soles of the feet, keeps the stomach muscles in and gives agility
to the body and the mind.
10. Ardha Chandrasana Five* (Plate 1 9)

5 · The weight of the body is borne on the right foot and hip. The right
hand is only a support to control the balance.
6. Hold the pose from 20 to 30 seconds, breathing deeply and evenly.
Then slide the left leg to the floor and go back to Triko�asana.
(Plate 4)
7· Repeat the pose on the left side.
Effects
The posture is beneficial for those whose legs are damaged or infected.
It tones the lower region of the spine and the nerves connected with
the leg muscles and it strengthens the knees. Along with other standing
postures, this asana cures gastric troubles.
Note. Those who feel weak and are exhausted by the standing poses
should only practise Utthita Trikonasana (Plate 4) and Utthita
Parsvako�asana (Plate 8), as these two asanas strengthen the body.
The other standing asanas should be done only by people who have
built up their strength and whose bodies have become elastic.

Effects
This asana relieves stiffness in the legs and hip muscles and makes
the hip joints and spine elastic. While the head is resting on the knees,
the abdominal organs are contracted and toned. The wrists move freely
and any stiffness there disappears. The posture also corrects round and
drooping shoulders. In the correct pose, the shoulders are drawn well
back and this makes deep breathing easier.

Effects
In this pose the hamstring and abductor muscles are fully developed,
while blood is made to flow to the trunk and the head. People who
cannot do Slr�asana (Plate 1 84) can benefit from this pose, which in­
creases digestive powers.
All the standing poses described ahove are necessary for beginners.
As the pupil advances he attains better flexibility and then the stand­
ing poses can be dispensed with, though it is advisable to do them
once a week. All these standing poses help to reduce the body weight.

Effects of PadanguHhruana and Padahastasana
The second asana is more strenuous than the first, but the effects of
both are the same. The abdominal organs are toned and digestive
juices increase, while the liver and spleen are activated. Persons suffer­
ing from a bloating sensation in the abdomen or from gastric troubles
will benefit by practising these two asanas.
Slipped spinal discs can only b e adjusted in the concave back
position as in Plates 43 and 45· Do not bring the head in between the
knees if you have a displaced disc. I have experimented with persons
suffering from slipped discs and the concave back position proved a boon
to them. It is imperative to get guidance from a guru (master) before
trying this pose, because it may not be possible to achieve the concave
back position immediately. One has to master other minor poses before
attempting this one.
20. Uttanasana Eight* (Plate 48)
Ut is a particle indicating deliberation, intensity. The verb tan means
to stretch, extend, lengthen out. In this asana, the spine is given a
deliberate and an intense stretch.

2. Exhale, bend forward and place the fingers on the floor. Then place
the palms on the floor by the side of the feet, behind the heels. Do
not bend the legs at the knees. (Plate 47)
3· Try to hold the head up and stretch the spine. Move the hips a
little forward towards the head so as to bring the legs perpendicular
to the floor.
4· Remain in this position and take two deep breaths.
5· Exhale, move the trunk closer to the legs and rest the head on the
knees. (Plate 48)
6. Do not slacken the grip at the knees, but pull the knee-caps well
up. Hold this position for a minute with deep and even breathing.
7· Inhale and raise the head from the knees, but without lifting the
palms from the floor. (Plate 47)

the kidneys. It also relieves stomach pain during menstrual periods.
The heart beats are slowed down and the spinal nerves rejuvenated.
Any depression felt in the mind is removed if one holds the pose for
two minutes or more. The posture is a boon to people who get excited
quickly, as ir soothes the brain cells. After finishing the asana, one feels
calm and cool, the eyes start to glow and the mind feels at peace.
Persons who feel heaviness in the head, flushing or any discomfort
while attempting Si'rsasana (Plate 184), should do Uttanasana first;
then they will be abl� to do Si'r�asana (the head stand) with comfort
and ease.

Effects
Stiffness of the knees is cured by this asana. As the abdominal organs
are contracted, digestive powers increase and the peristaltic activity
helps to eliminate toxin creating waste matter. The pose helps one to
move the shoulders further back. This expands the chest and helps in
breathing freely and deeply.

the back of the left thigh on the front of the right thigh.
3· Then move the left foot behind the right calf so that the left shin
touches the right calf and the left big toe hooks just above the inner side
of the right ankle. The left leg is now entwined around the right leg.
4 · You are balancing on the right leg only; this will take some time to
learn.
5· Bend the elbow and raise the arms to the level of the chest. Rest the
right elbow on the front of the left upper arm near the elbow joint. Then
move the right hand back to the right and the left hand back to the left
and join the palms. The left arm will now be entwined around the right
arm. (Plate 56)
6. Remain in this position for a few seconds, say about I5 to 20 with
deep breathing. Then release the arms and legs and come back to
Ta<;J.asana. (Plate I)
7· Repeat the pose, standing on the left leg and entwining the right leg
around the left leg and the right arm around the left arm. Stay for an
equal length of time on both the sides.
Effects
This asana develops the ankles and removes stiffness in the shoulders.
It is recommended for preventing cramps in the calf muscles. For
removing cramps in the legs and for relieving pain the poses recom­
mended are Garu<;lasana, Virasana (Plate 89) and Bhekasana, also called

the trunk off the floor and place the top of the left knee on the floor.
Place the right foot near the bent left knee and keep the right thigh
parallel to the floor. (Plate 57)
3· Stretch the pelvis forward, keep the left thigh perpendicular to the
floor, raise the hands, straighten the back and balance the body. Do not
stoop forward while maintaining the balance, but keep the back erect.
4· Bend the elbows and raise the arms to the level of the chest. Place the
back of the upper right arm near the elbow on the front of the upper
left arm above the elbow joint. Entwine the forearms round one another
and join the palms. Hold this position for about 30 seconds with normal
breathing. (Front view : Plate 58. Side view : Plate 59)
5· Release the arms, sit on the floor and straighten the legs.

6. Repeat the pose on the other side. Here, place the right foot at the
root of the left thigh, place the left foot near the bent right knee on the
floor and entwine the arms in front of the chest so that the left arm is
over the right near the elbow joint, and palance, keeping the left thigh
parallel to the floor. Maintain the pqse for an equal length of time on
both sides. Then rele�e the pose and relax on the floor.
' '

7. In the beginning, it will be difficult to balance and the knees will be
painful. With practice the pain disappears and the balance is achieved.

Effects
In this pose the hip joints receive proper circulation of the blood and
minor deformity in the hips and thighs is corrected. The pose is also
good for stiffness in the sacroiliac region.

25. Salabhasana One* (Plate 6o)
Salabha means a locust. The pose resembles that of a locust resting on

the ground, hence the name.

·

Technique
1 . Lie full length on the floor on the stomach, face downwards. Stretch

the arms back.

2. Exhale, lift the head, chest and legs off the floor simultaneously as

high as possible. The hands should not be placed and the ribs should

100

not rest on the floor. Only the abdominal front portion of the body rests
on the floor and bears the weight of the body. (Plate 6o)

6o
3· Contract the buttocks and stretch the thigh muscles. Keep both legs
fully extended and straight, touching at the thighs, knees and ankles.
4· Do not bear the weight of the body on the hands but stretch them
back to exercise the upper portion of the back muscles.
5· Stay in the position as long as you can with normal breathing.
6. In the beginning it is difficult to lift the chest and the legs off the
floor, but this becomes easier as the abdominal muscles grow stronger.
Effects
The pose aids digestion and relieves gastric troubles and flatulence.
Since the spine is stretched back it becomes elastic and the pose relieves
pain in the sacral and lumbar regions. In my experience, persons suffer­
ing from slipped discs have benefited.b y regular practice of this asana
without recourse to enforced rest or surgical treatment. The bladder and
the prostate gland also benefit from the exercise and remain healthy.
A variation of the pose may also be tried to relieve aches in the lower
part of the back. Here, the legs are bent at the knees and the thighs are
kept apart while the shins are kept perpendicular to the floor. Then with
an exhalation, the thighs are lifted off the floor and brought closer
together until the knees touch, the shins still being kept perpendicular.
(Plate 61)
Verse 40 of the second chapter of the GheraQ.<;ia Sarilhita describes
26. Makarasana (Plate 62) thus :
'Lie on the ground face down, the chest touching the earth and both
legs stretched out: catch the head with the arms. This is the Crocodile
Posture which increases bodily heat.' It is a variation of Salabhasana.

27. Dhanurasana Four* (Plate 63)

Dhanu means a bow. The hands here are used like a bow-string to pull
the head, trunk and legs up and the posture resembles a bent bow.
Technique
1 . Lie full length on the floor on the stomach, face downwards.
2. Exhale and bend the knees. Stretch the arms back and hold the left

ankle with the left hand and the right ankle with the right hand. Take
two breaths.
3· Now exhale completely and pull the legs up by raising the knees
above the floor, and simultaneously lift the chest off the floor. The arms
and hands act like a bow-string to tauten the body like a bent bow.
(Plate 63)
4· Lift up the head and pull it as far back as possible. Do not rest either

the ribs or the pelvic bones on the floor. Only the abdomen bears the
weight of the body on the floor.
5· While raising the legs do not join them at the knees, for then the legs
will not be lifted high enough. After the full stretch upwards has been
achieved, join together the thighs, the knees and the ankles.
6. Since the abdomen is extended, the breathing will be fast, but do not
worry about it. Stay in the pose to your capacity from 20 seconds to
one minute.
7· Then, with an exhalation, release the ankles, stretch the legs straight,
bring the head and the legs back to the floor and relax.
Effects
In this posture the spine is stretched back. Elderly people do not normally
do this, so their spines get rigid. This asana brings back elasticity to the
spine and tones the abdominal organs. In my experience, persons suffer­
ing from slipped d�scs have obtained relief by the regular practice of
Dhanurasana and Salabhasana (Plate 6o) without being forced to rest
or to undergo surgical treatment.
28. Parsva Dhanurasana Four* (P_lates 64 and 65)
Parsva means sideways. In this variation of Dhanurasana, one performs
the posture lying on one's side.

3· Inhale and come to position r . Then exhale, and roll over to the left
side. (Plate 65)

4· Stay on either side for the same length of time according to your
capacity with normal breathing. Inhale, come back to Dhanurasana,
release the legs and relax.
5· In this pose, which is a more strenuous version of the earlier one, the
ankles are inclined to slip from the hand grip. Therefore, grip the ankles
more firmly.

104

Effects
The sideways roll in this posture massages the abdominal organs by
pressing them against the floor.
29. Chaturanga DarJ4osana One* (Plate 67)
Chatur means four. Ailga means a limb or a part thereof. Dat:lc;ia means
a staff. Lie flat on the floor, face down and take the weight of the body
on the palms and toes, exhale and keep the body parallel to the floor,
stiff as a staff. The four limbs supporting the body are the hands and
feet. The pose is similar to dips in western gymnastics.
Technique
1 . Lie flat on the floor, face downwards.
Bend the elbows and place the palms by the side of the chest. Keep
the feet about a foot apart.
2.

3· With an exhalation, raise the whole body a few inches above the floor,
balancing it on the hands and the toes. (Plate 66.) Keep the body stiff
as a staff, parallel to the floor from head to heel and the knees taut. Stay
for some time with normal breathing.

66
4· Then gradually extend the whole body forward so that the feet rest on

the upper portion of the toes on the floor. (Plate 67)
5· Stay in the pose for about 30 seconds with normal or deep breathing.

The movement may be repeated several times. Then relax on the floor.

Nakra means a crocodile. This posture consists of several dynamic
movements resembling those of a crocodile stalking its prey, hence the
name.

3· Keep the feet about one foot apart. Exhale, raise the whole body a
few inches above the floor, balancing it on the palms and the toes. KeeJ:­
the body stiff as a poker and the knees taut. The body should remain
parallel to the floor. (Plate 68)
4· Take a few breaths and with an exhalation lunge the whole body a
foot forward, lifting the hands and feet simultaneously off the floor.
(Plates 69, 70 and 7 1 . ) After going a foot forward, take a few breaths.
Then exhale and lung� forward again.
5· Repeat the forward lunges four or five times. At the end of each lunge,
the position of the body should be as described in position 3 above.
These movements resemble the lunges made by a crocodile stalking its
prey. After each lunge, rest a few seconds taking deep breaths.

6. Now reverse the movements and with exhalations jump back about
a foot at a time until you return to the position from where you started.
7. Rest the trunk on the floor and relax.
Effects
This asana develops powerful wrists, throws off lethargy of the body and
fatigue of the brain, rejuvenates the entire body and makes one feel lively
and vigorous. Since the movements bring great pressure on the wrists,
it is recommended that they be tried gradually, otherwise one is apt to
sprain the wrists.
3 1 . Bhujaizgasana I One* (Plate 73)
Bhujailga means a serpent. In this posture, lie flat on the floor, face
downwards, lift the body up from the trunk and throw the head back
like a serpent about to strike.
Technique
r. Lie on the floor face downwards. Extend the legs, keeping the feet
together. Keep the knees tight and the toes pointing.
2. Rest the palms by the side of the pelvic region.
3· Inhale, press the palms firmly on the floor and pull the trunk up.
(Plate 72.) Take two breaths.
4· Inhale, lift the body up from the trunk until the pubis is in contact
with the floor and stay in this position with the weight on the legs and
palms. (Plate 73)

6. Maintain the pose for about 20 seconds, breathing normally.

7· Exhale, bend the elbows and rest the trunk on the floor. Repeat the
pose two or three times and then relax.
Effects
The posture is a panacea for an injured spine and in cases of slight dis­
placement of spinal discs the practice of this pose replaces the discs in
their original position. The spinal region is toned and the chest fully
expanded.

back. Place the palms on the floor by the side of the waist, the fingers
pointing to the head.
3· Inhale, raise the head and trunk, stretch the arms completely and
push the head and trunk as far back as possible, without resting the
knees on the floor.
4· Keep the legs straight and tightened at the knees, but do not rest the
knees on the floor. The weight of the body rests on the palms and toes
only. (Plate 74)

74

5· The spine, thighs and calves should be fully stretched, and the but­
tocks contracted tight. Push the chest forward, stretch the neck fully
and throw the head as far back as possible. Stretch also the back portions
of the arms.
6. Stay in the pose from half a minute to a minute with deep breathing.
7· Bend the elbows, release the stretch and rest on the floor.

Effects
The pose rejuvenates the spine and is specially recommended for people
suffering from a stiff back. The movement is good for persons with
lumbago, sciatica and those suffering from slipped or prolapsed discs of
the spine. The pose strengthens the spine and cures backaches. Due
to chest expansion, the lungs gain elasticity. The blood circulates
properly in the pelvic region and keeps it healthy.

Adho Mukha means having the face downwards. Svana means a dog.
The pose resembles a dog stretching itself with head and forelegs down
and the hind legs up, hence the name.
Technique
Lie full length on the floor on the stomach, face downwards. The
feet should be kept one foot apart.

2. Rest the palms by the side of the chest, the fingers straight and
pointing in the direction of the head.
3· Exhale and raise the trunk from the floor. Straighten the arms, move
the head inwards towards the feet and place the crown of the head on
the floor, keeping the elbows straight and extending the back. (Side
view: Plate 75· Back view: Plate 76)

4· Keep the legs stiff and do not bend the knees but press the heels down.
The heels and soles of the feet should rest completely on the floor,
while the feet should be parallel to each other, the toes pointing straight
ahead.
5 · Stay in the pose for about a minute with deep breathing. Then with
an exhalation lift the head off the floor, stretch the trunk forward and
lower the body gently to the floor and relax.
Effects
When one is exhausted, a longer stay in this pose removes fatigue and
brings back the lost energy. The pose is especially good for runners who
get tired after a hard race. Sprinters will develop speed and lightness in
the legs. The pose relieves pain and stiffness in the heels and helps to

soften calcaneal spurs. I t strengthens the ankles and makes the legs
shapely. The practice of this asana helps to eradicate stiffness in the
region of the shoulder-blades, and arthritis of the shoulder joints is
relieved. The abdominal muscles are drawn towards the spine and
strengthened. As the diaphragm is lifted to the chest cavity the rate of
the heart beat is slowed down. This is an exhilarating pose.
Those who are afraid to do Sir�asana (Plate r 84) can conveniently
practise this position. As the trunk is lowered in this asana it is fully
stretched and healthy blood is brought to this region without any strain
on the heart. It rejuvenates the brain cells and invigorates the brain by
relieving fatigue.
Persons suffering from high blood pressure can do this pose.

34· Paripurna Navasana Two* (Plate 78)
Paripiin.:ta means entire or complete. The posture here resembles that
of a boat with oars, hence the name.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. Place the
palms on the floor by the hips, the fingers pointing to the feet. Stretch
the hands straight and keep the back erect. This position is called :

35· Da'f}cf,asana Two* (Plate 77) (Da�9a = a staff or rod)

2. Exhale, recline the trunk slightly back and simultaneously raise the
legs from the floor and keep them stiff as a poker with the knees tight
and the toes pointing forwards. Balance is maintained only on the
buttocks and no part of the spine should be allowed to touch the floor,
from which the legs should be kept at an angle of 6o to 65 degrees. The
feet are higher than the head and not level with it as in Ardha Navasana.
(Plate 79)
3· Remove the hands from the floor and stretch the arms forward,
keeping them parallel to the floor and near the thighs. The shoulders
and the palms should be on one level, and the palms should face each
other. (Plate 78)

4· Stay in the pose for half a minute, with normal breathing. Gradually

increase the time to one minute. One feels the effect of the exercise after
only 20 seconds.

5· Then exhale, lower the hands, rest the legs on the floor and relax by
lying on the back.

Effects
This asana gives relief to persons who feel a bloating sensation in the
abdomen due to gas and also to those suffering from gastric complaints.
It reduces fat around the waistline and tones the kidneys.
36. Ardha Navasana Two* (Plate 79)

Ardha means half. Nava is a ship, boat or vessel. This postuFe resembles
the shape of a boat, hence the name.

Technique
1 . Sit on the floor. Stretch the legs out in front and keep them straight.

2. Interlock the fingers and place them on the back of the head just
above the neck.
3· Exhale, recline the trunk back and simultaneously raise the legs from
the floor, keeping the knees tight and the toes pointed. The balance of
the body rests on the buttocks and no part of the spine should be
allowed to touch the floor. (Plate 79.) One feels the grip on the muscles
of the abdomen and the lower back.

79
4· Keep the legs at an angle of about 30 to 35 degrees from the floor
and the crown of the head in line with the toes.

114

Light on Yoga

5. Hold this pose for 20 to 30 seconds with normal breathing. A stay for
one minute in this posture indicates strong abdominal muscles.
6. Do not hold the breath during this asana, though the tendency is
always to do it with suspension of breath after inhalation. If the breath is
held, the effect will be felt on the stomach muscles and not on the
abdominal organs. Deep inhalation in this asana would loosen the grip
on the abdominal muscles. In order to maintain this grip, inhale, exhale
and hold the breath and go on repeating this process but without breath­
ing deeply. This will exercise not only the abdominal muscles but the
organs also.

7. The difference between Ardha Navasana and Paripiin;ta Navas ana
should be noted ; in the latter, the legs are moved higher and the distance
between them and the stomach is less than in the former.
Effects
The effects of Ardha Navasana and that of ParipiirQ.a Navasana (Plate
78) differ due to the position of the legs. In ParipiirQ.a Navasana the
exercise is effective on the intestines; whereas, Ardha Navasana works
on the liver, gall bladder and spleen.
In the beginning, the back is too weak to bear the strain of the pose.
When power to retain the pose comes, it indicates that the back is gaining
strength. A weak back is a handicap in many ways, especially to women
as they need strong backs for child-bearing. These two asanas coupled
with lateral twistings of the spine will help to strengthen the back.
The importance of having a healthy lower back can be realised if we
watch old people when they sit down, get up and walk, for consciously
or unconsciously they support their backs with their hands. This in­
dicates that the back is weak and cannot withstand the strain. As long as
it is strong and needs no support, one feels young though advanced in
age. The two asanas bring life and vigour to the back and enable us to
grow old gracefully and comfortably.
37. Gomukhasana Two* (Plate 8o)
Go means a cow. Mukha means face. Gomukha means one whose face
resembles a cow. It also means a kind of a musical instrument, narrow
at one end and broad at the other like the face of a cow.
Technique
I. Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Place the palms on the floor and raise the seat.
3· Bend the left knee back and sit on the left foot. Remove the hands

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

from the floor, raise the right leg and place the right thigh over the left
one. Raise the buttocks and with the help of the hands bring the ankles
and the back of the heels together till they touch each other.
4· Rest the anklesy keeping the toes pointing back.
5· Raise the left arm over the head, bend it at the elbow and place the left

palm below the nape of the neck between the shoulders. Lower the right
arm, bend it at the elbow and raise the right forearm up behind the back
until the right hand is level with and between the shoulder-blades. Clasp
the hands behind the back between the shoulders. (Front view : Plate 8o.

6. Hold this position from 30 to 6o seconds breathing normally. Keep
the neck and head erect and look straight ahead.
7· Unclasp the hands, straighten the legs and repeat the pose on the
other side for the same length of time by inserting 'left' for 'right' and
vice versa. Then unclasp the hands at the back, straighten the legs and
relax.

Effects
The pose cures cramp in the legs and makes the leg muscles elastic.

The chest is well expanded and the back becomes erect. The shoulder
joints move freely and the latissimus dorsi are fully extended.
38. Lolasana Six* (Plate 83)
Lola means tremulous, moving to and fro or dangling like an ear-ring.
In this posture the legs and feet are kept as in Gomukhasana. (Plate
So.) The hands are placed on the floor by the side of the hips and the
body is raised up and supported only by the hands and wrists. Then one
balances swaying slightly forward and backward, the movement re­
sembling that of a dangling pendant.

Technique
r. Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)

2. Place the palms on the floor by the side of the hips.
3· Raise the seat, bend the right knee back, place the right sole beneath
the left buttock and sit on it.
4· Bend the left knee back and again raising the seat, place the left sole
beneath the right buttock and sit on it.
5 · The feet will be crossed so that the right shin is above the left calf.
Keep the toes pointing backwards. (Plate 82)
6. Take a few breaths. Exhale, raise the trunk and legs off the floor and
balance on the hands, stretching out the arms. (Plate 83.) Gently rock
the trunk and legs forwards and backwards. Breathe normally.
7. Rest on the floor and uncross the legs.
8. Recross the legs the other way and again balance on the hands.
9· Balance as long as possible.

Effects
This asana strengthens the wrists and hands, the muscles of the back and
the abdominal organs. It makes the leg muscles elastic and the minor
muscles of the arms will be developed and toned.
39· Siddhasana One* (Plate 84)
Siddha means a semi-divine being supposed to be of great purity and
holiness, and to possess supernatural faculties called siddhis. Siddha
means also an inspired sage, seer or prophet.
'The Siddhas say that as among niyamas, the most important is not
to harm anyone, and among the yamas a moderate diet, so is Siddhasana
among the asanas.'

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

82

'Of the 84 lacs of asanas, one should always practise Siddhasana. It
purifies 72,ooo na<;i1s.' (Na<;i1s are channels in the human body through
which nervous energy passes.)
'The yogin practising contemplation upon Atman and observing a
moderate diet, i� he practises Siddhasana for twelve years, obtains the
yoga siddhis. ' (Atman means the Self and the supreme Soul. Siddh1s
are supernatural faculties.)
'When Siddhasana is mastered, the Unman! Avastha (Samadhi) that
gives delight follows without effort and naturally.'
The soul has three avasthas or conditions which are included in a
fourth. They are waking, dreaming, sleeping and what is called Tur1ya.
'The first condition is that of wakefulness, where the self is conscious
of the common world of gross objects. It enjoys gross things. Here
the dependence of body is predominant. The second condition is that
of dreaming, where the self enjoys subtle things, fashioning for itself a
new world of forms from the material of its waking experience. The
spirit is said to roam freely unfettered by the bonds of the body. The
third condition is that of sound sleep, where we have neither dreams nor
desires. It is called su�upti. In it the soul is said to become temporarily
one with Brahman and to enjoy bliss. In deep sleep we are lifted above

I r8

Light on Yoga

all desires and freed from the vexations of spirit. . . . The soul is divine

in origin, though clogged with the flesh. In sleep it is said to be
released from the shackles of the body and to regain its own nature . . . .
But this (that is, the eternal dreamless sleep) is likely to be confused
with sheer unconsciousness . . . . The highest is not this dreamless sleep,
but another, a fourth state of the soul, a pure intuitional consciousness
where there is no knowledge of objects internal or external. In deep sleep
the spirit dwells in a region far above the changeful life ofsense in absolute
union with Brahman. The turlya condition brings out the positive aspect
of the negative emphasised in the condition of deep sleep . ' - Radha­
krishnan in Philosophy of the Upanishads. This fourth condition has been
thus described in the Mat:t<;liikya Upanishad as follows : 'The fourrh,
say the wise, is not subjective experience, nor objective experience, nor
experience intermediate between the two, nor is it a negative condition
which is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. It is not the know­
ledge of the senses, nor is it relative knowledge, nor yet inferential
knowledge. Beyond the senses, beyond understanding, beyond all ex­
pression, is the fourth. It is pure unitary consciousness, wherein all
awareness of the world and of multiplicity is completely obliterated. It
is the supreme good. It is One without a second. It is the Self. Know
it alone !'
'Raja-Yoga, Samadhi, Unmanl, Manomanl, Immortality, Concentra­
tion, Siinyasiinya (void and yet non-void), Parama Pada (the Supreme
State), Amanaska (suspended operation of the mind), Advaita (non­
duality), Niralamba (without support), Nirailjana (pure), Jlvanmukti
(emancipated state), Sahajavastha (natural state) and Turlya (literally
the Fourth), all mean the same thing. As a grain of salt thrown into
water unites and becomes one with it, a like union between the Mind
and the Atman is Samadhi. When Pra�a and Manas (mind) are
annihilated (absorbed), the state of harmony then arising is called
Samadhi . ' - lfafha Yoga Prad'fpikii, chapter IV, verses 3 to 6.
There is no asana like Siddha, no kumbhaka like Kevala, no mudra
like Khecharl, and no laya (absorption of the mind) like Nada.
(Khecharl Mudra, literally roaming through space, is described in the
Gheranda Sainhita as follows in verses 25 to 28 of the third chapter:
'Cut the lower tendon of the tongue and move the tongue constantly;
rub it with fresh butter, and draw it out (to lengthen it) with an iron
instrument. By practising this always, the tongue becomes long and
when it reaches the space between the eyebrows, then Khecharl is
accomplished. Then (the tongue being lengthened) practise turning it
up and back so as to touch the palate, till at length it reaches the holes
of the nostrils opening into the mouth. Close those holes with the tongue
(thus stopping inspiration), and gaze on the space between the eyebrows.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriyli

This is called Khechari'. By this practice there is neither fainting, nor
hunger, nor thirst, nor laziness. There comes neither disease, nor decay,
nor death. The body becomes divine.')
(Nada is the inner mystical sound. Verses 79 to 101 of the fourth
chapter describes it in great detail with a variety of similes. Yoga is
defined as control over the aberrations of the mind. In order to control
the mind it is necessary that it should first be absorbed in concentration
of some object, then it is gradually withdrawn from that object and made
to look within one's own self. This is where the yogi is asked to con­
centrate upon the inner mystical sounds. 'The mind is like a serpent,
forgetting all its unsteadiness by hearing Nada, it does not run away
anywhere.' Gradually as Nada becomes latent so does the mind along
with it. 'The fire, catching the wood, is extinguished along with it
(after burning it up) ; and so the mind also, working with Nada, becomes
latent along with it.')
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor, with legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the left leg at the knee. Hold the left foot with the hands, place
the heel near the perineum and rest the sole of the left foot against
the right thigh.
3· Now bend the right leg at the knee and place the right foot over the
left ankle, keeping the right heel against the pubic bone.
4· Place the sole of the right foot between the thigh and the calf of the
left leg.
5 · Do not rest the body on the heels.
6. Stretch the arms in front and rest the back of the hands on the knees
so that the palms face upwards. Join the thumbs and the forefingers
and keep the other fingers extended. (Plate 84)

7· Hold this position as long as you can, keeping the back, neck and head
erect and the vision indrawn as if gazing at the tip of the nose.

8. Release the feet and relax for some time. Then repeat the pose for

the same length of time, now placing the right heel near the perineum
first and then the left foot over the right ankle as described above.
Effects

This posture keeps the pubic region healthy. Like Padmasana (Plate
1 04), it is one of the most relaxing of asanas. The body being in a sitting
posture is at rest, while the position of the crossed legs and erect back

120

Light on Yoga

keeps the mind attentive and alert. This asana is also recommended for
the practice of prai).ayama and for meditation.
From the purely physical point of view, the asana is good for curing
stiffness in the knees and ankles. In it the blood circulates in the lumbar
region and the abdomen, and this tones the lower region of the spine and
the abdominal organs.
40. Vzrasana One* (Plate 89)
V!ra means a hero, warrior, champion. This sitting posture is done by
keeping the knees together, spreading the feet and resting them by the
side of the hips.
The pose is good for meditation and prai).ayama.
Technique
1. Kneel on the floor. Keep the knees together and spread the feet about
1 8 inches apart.
2. Rest the buttocks on the floor, but not the body on the feet. The feet
are kept by the side of the thighs, the inner side of each calf touching
the outer side of its respective thigh. Keep the toes pointing back and
touching the floor. Keep the wrists on the knees, palms facing up, and
join the tips of the thumbs and forefingers. Keep the other fingers
extended. Stretch the back erect. (Back view: Plate 88. Front view:
Plate 89)
3· Stay in this position as long as you can, with deep breathing.
4· Then rest the palms on the knees for a while. (Side view : Plate 90)

8. Stay in this position for a minute with normal breathing.
9· Inhale, raise the trunk up, bring the feet forward and relax.
10. If you find it difficult to perform the pose as described above, try
placing the feet one above the other and rest the buttocks on them. (Plate
85.) Gradually move the toes further apart, separate the feet (Plates 86
and 87) and bring them to rest outside the thighs. Then, in time the
buttocks will rest properly on the floor and the body will not rest on the
feet.
Effects
The pose cures rheumatic pains in the kn�es and gout, and is also good
for flat feet. Due to the stretching of the ankles and the feet, proper
arches will be formed. This, however, takes a long time and requires

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

daily practice of the pose for a few minutes for several months. Those
suffering from pain in the heels or growth of calcaneal spurs there will
get relief and the spurs will gradually disappear.
The pose qm even be done immediately after food and will relieve
heaviness in the stomach.
41. Supta Vzrasana Two* (Plate 96)
Supta means lying down. In this asana one reclines back on the floor
and stretches the arms behind the head.

Technique
I . Sit in Vi'rasana. (Plate 89)

2. Exhale, recline the trunk back and rest the elbows one by one on the
floor. (Plate 93)
3· Relieve the pressure on the elbows one after the other by extending
the arms.
4. At first rest the crown of the head on the floor. (Plate 94.) Gradually
rest the back of the head and then the back on the floor7 (Plate 95.) Take
thearms overthe head and stretch them out straight. (Plate 96.) Hold this
pose as long as you can while breathing deeply. Then place the arms
beside the trunk, press the elbows to the floor and sit up again with an
exhalation.

5· The hands may be stretched over the head or placed beside the
thighs. When they are stretched over the head, do not raise the shoulder­
blades from the floor.
6. Beginners may keep the knees apart.
Effects

This asana stretches the abdominal organs and the pelvic region. People
whose legs ache will get relief from holding this pose for 10 to 1 5 minutes
and it is recommended to athletes and all who have to walk or stand
about for long hours. It can be done after meals and if before retiring
at night the legs feel rested next morning. Several of my P':lPils who were
cadets at the National Pefence Academy after long route marches found
great relief by combining this as ana with Sarvangasana I. (Plate 223)
42. Paryankasana Two* (Plate 97)
Paryanka means a bed, couch or sofa. This asana is a continuation of
Supta Vlrasana. (Plate 96.) I n it the body resembles a couch, hence the
name.
Technique

1 . Sit in Vfrasana. (Plate 89)
2. Exhale and recline on the back. (Plate 93.) Lift the neck and the chest
and arching the back up rest only the crown of the head on the floor.
(Plate 94.) No part of the trunk should be on the floor.
3· Bend the arms at the elbows. Hold with the right hand the left upper
arm near the elbow and with the left hand the right upper arm near the
elbow. Rest the folded arms on the floor behind the head. (Plate 97)
4· Stay in the pose for a minute with even breathing.

5· Inhale, rest the trunk and neck on the floor, release the hands and
sit up in Vfrasana. (Plate 89)
6. Then straighten the legs one by one, lie flat on the back and
relax.
Effects
As in Matsyasana (Plate r 13) and Paryankasana the dorsal region is
fully extended so that the lungs are well expanded. The neck muscles
are stretched and the thyroids and parathyroids are stimulated so
that they function properly. Those who cannot perform Matsyasana
will derive the same benefit from this exercise.
Whereas Vfrasana (Plate 89) and Supta Vfrasana (Plate 96) can be
done at any time, even immediately after taking food, Paryankasana
cannot be done immediately after a meal.

43· Bheka.sana (also called Maz;1c;i�kasana) Four* (Plate roo)
Bheka means a frog. The action in this asana resembles that of a frog,
hence the name.

Technique
I . Lie full length on the floor on th� stomach, face downwards. Stretch
the arms back.

2. Exhale, benq the knees and move the heels towards the hips. Hold
the sole of the right foot with the right hand and the sole of the left
foot with the left hand. (Plate 98.) Take two breaths. Exhale, lift the
head and trunk from the floor and look up.
3· Now tum the hands so that the palms touch the upper part of the
feet and the toes and fingers point to the head. (Plate 99.) Push the

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

127

hands further down and bring the toes and heels closer to the ground.
Keep the arms from the wrists to the elbows perpendicular. (Plate
100.) When the knees and ankles become flexible, the heels can be made
to touch the floor.

99

100
4· Remain in the pose from 1 5 to 30 seconds, but do not hold the
breath. Exhale, release the palms from the feet, stretch the legs and
relax.
Effects

The abdominal organs benefit from the exercise as they are pressed
against the floor. The knees become firmer and the pose relieves pain
in the knee joints due to rheumatism and gout. It also gives relief when
there is any internal derangement of the knee joints. The pressure of
the hands on the feet creates a proper arch and so cures flat feet. It
helps sprained ankles and strengthens them. The pose also relieves pain
in the heels. By continued practice of this asana, the heels become

128

Light on Yoga

softer. Persons suffering from calcaneal spurs in the heels benefit from
it as well as from Vidisana. (Plate 89)
44· Baddha KorJiisana Three* (Plate I02)

Baddha means caught, restrained. Kol)a means an angle. I n this
posture, sit on the floor, bring the heels near the perineum, catch the
feet and widen the thighs until the knees touch the floor on either side.
This is how Indian cobblers sit.
Technique

I . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the knees and bring the feet closer to the trunk.
Bring the soles and heels of the feet together and catching the feet
near the toes, bring the heels near the perineum. The outer sides of
both feet should rest on the floor, and the back of the heels should
touch the perineum.
3·

4· Widen the thighs and lower the knees until they touch the floor.

5 . Interlock the fingers of the hands, grip the feet firmly, stretch the

spine erect and gaze straight ahead or at the tip of the nose. (Plate
IOI.) Hold the pose as long as you can.

IOI

6. Place the elbows on the thighs and press them down. Exhale, bend

forward, rest the head, then the nose and lastly the chin on the floor.
(Plate I 02.) Hold this position from half a minute to a minute with
normal breathing.

7. Inhale, raise the trunk from the floor and come back to position 5 ·
(Plate IOI)
8. Then release the feet, straighten the legs and relax.
Effects

The pose is specially recommended for those suffering from urinary
disorders. The pelvis, the abdomen and the back get a plentiful supply
of blood and are stimulated. It keeps the kidneys, the prostate and
the urinary bladder healthy. It is well known that diseases of the
urinary tract are rarely found among the Indian cobblers and the reason
for that is that they sit all day in this pose.
It relieves sciatic pain and prevents hernia. If practised regularly,
it relieves pain and heaviness in the testicles.
The pose is a blessing to women. Coupled with Sarvangasana I
(Plate 223) and its cycle (Plates 235 to 271 ) it checks irregular menstrual
periods and helps the ovaries to function properly. It is found that
pregnant women who sit daily in this pose for a few minutes will have
much less pain during delivery and will be free from varicose veins.
(It is recommended for pregnant women in Dr Grantly Dick Reed's
book Childbirth Without Fear.)
Along with Padmasana (Plate 1 04) and Vfrasana (Plate 89) this
asana is recommended for PraQ.ayama practice and for meditation.
When sitting in meditation in this pose the palms should be folded
in front of the chest (Plate 103), but to do this with the back erect
requires practice. This asana can be done without fear even after meals
as long as the head is not rested on the floor.
45. Padmasana Four* (Plate r 04)
Padma means a lotus. This is the lotus posture, one of the most

I 30

Light on Yoga

103

important and useful asanas. It is the posture for meditation and the
Buddha is often depicted in it.
Verse 48 of the first chapter of the Hafha Yoga Pracfipika describes
the posture and the practice of breath control while seated in it thus :
'Assuming Padmasana and having placed the palms one upon
another, fix the chin firmly upon the breast and contemplating upon
Brahman, frequently contract the anus and raise the apana up ; by
similar contraction of the throat force the prana down. By this he
obtains unequalled knowledge through the favour of Kundalin! (whicb
is roused by this process).'
Kutf9alin1 is the Divine Cosmic Energy in bodies. It is symbolised
by a coiled and sleeping serpent in the lowest bodily centre at the base
of the spinal column. This latent energy has to be awakened and made
to go up the spine to the brain through Su�umna Na9i, a channel
through which nervous energy passes, and through the six chakras, the
subtle centres in the body, the fly-wheels in the nervous system of the
human machine. The awakening of Kutf9alin1 is discussed in detail in
Arthur Avalon's (Sir John Woodroffe's) book entitled The Serpent
Power.

This is one of the basic postures and is often used in the variations
of S!r�asana and Sarvangasana.
Technique
I . Sit on the floor with the legs straight. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the right leg at the knee, hold the right foot with the hands

and place it at the root of the left thigh so that the right heel is near
the navel.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

131

3· Now bend the left leg, and holding the left foot with the hands
place it over the right at the root, the heel being near the navel. The
soles of the feet should be turned up. This is the basic Padmasana
pose. (Plate 1 04)

104

105
4 · People not used to sitting on the floor seldom have flexible knees.
At the start they will feel excruciating pain around the knees. By
perseverance and continued practice the pain will gradually subside
and they can then stay in the pose comfortably for a long time.
5 · From the base to the neck the spine should remain erect. The arms
may be stretched out, the right hand being placed on the right knee
and the left hand on the left knee. The forefingers and the thumbs
are bent and touch each other. Another way of placing the hands is
in the middle where the feet cross each other with one palm upon the
other. (Plate 1 05)
6. Change the leg position by placing the left foot over the right

thigh and the right foot over the left thigh. This will develop the legs
evenly.
Effects

After the initial knee pains have been overcome, Padmasana is one of
the most relaxing poses. The body being in a sitting posture, it is at

132

Light on Yoga

rest without being sloppy. The position of the crossed legs and the
erect back keeps the mind attentive and alert. Hence it is one of the
asanas recommended for practising praQayama (breath control).
On the purely physical level, the pose is good for curing stiffness
in the knees and ankles. Since the blood is made to circulate in the
lumbar region and the abdomen, the spine and the abdominal organs
are toned.

46. $anmukhf Mudra Four* (Plate 106)
$an means six and mukha means the mouth. $anmukha is the name
of the six-headed god of war, also known as Kartikeya. Mudra means
a seal or closing up.
The posture is also called Parangmukhi' Mudra (facing inwards),
Sambhavi' Mudra (Sambhu is the name of Siva, father of Kartikeya.
Hence, Sambhava is the progeny of Siva), also as Yoni Mudra. Y oni
means the womb, the source. The mudra is so called because the
aspirant looks within himself to find the very source of his being.

Technique
1 . Sit in Padmasana. (Plate 1 04.) Keep the spine erect and the head
level.
2. Raise the hands to the face. Lift the elbows to the level of the
shoulders, place the thumbs on the ear-holes so as to cut off external
sounds. If the thumbs in the ear-hole cause pain, push the tragus
(the small prominence at the entrance of the external ear) over the ear­
holes and press it with the thumbs.
Close the eyelids, but turn the eyes up. Place the index and middle
fingers on the closed lids so that the first two phalanges only press
the entire eyeball. Do not, however, press the cornea. Pull the eye­
lids down with the middle finger. Push the upper part of the eyelids
below the eyebrow upwards with the index fingers. Gently press the
eyes at both the corners.
3·

4·

Equal pressure should be maintained on the ears and the eyes.

With the tips of the ring fingers press both nostrils equally. The
nasal passages are thus narrowed for slow, deep, steady, rhythmic
and subtle breathing.
5·

6. The little fingers are placed on the upper lip where they can check
the rhythmic flow of the breath.

7· Stay in this position as long as you can, drawing the vision
inwards. (Plate 106)

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kri'ya

133

ro6
Effects

The senses are turned inwards and the rhythmic breathing calms the
mind's wandering. This brings a feeling of inner peace and one hears
the divine voice of his self within, 'Look here ! look within! not out­
side, for the source of all peace is within yourself.' The posture thus
prepares the practitioner for the fifth stage of yoga, Pratyahara, where
he attempts to free himself from the thraldom of the senses and to
prevent them from running after their desires.
47· Parvatasana Four* (Plate 107)
Parva ta means a mountain. In this variation of Padmasana the arms
are stretched over the head with the fingers interlocked.
Techni'que
r . Sit in Pad mas ana. (Plate r 04)

2. Interlock the fingers, and stretch the hands vertically up over the

head. Keep the head bent forward with the chin on the breast bone.

3· Stretch the arms up from the latissimus dorsi (near the floating

ribs at the back) and the shoulder-blades. The palms should face
upwards. (Plate 107)

4· Hold the pos� for a minute or two with deep and even breathing.
Change the crossing of the legs and the interlock of the fingers and
repeat the pose, keeping the back erect.

Tola means a pair of scales. This pose resembles one pan of the scales,
hence the name.
Technique

49· Simhasana I One* (Plate 109)

Sirpha means a lion. This asana is dedicated to Narasirpha (Nara
= man : Sirpha = lion), the Man-Lion Incarnation of Vigm. It is
related that the demon king Hiral)ya Kasipu had obtained a boon
from Brahma ensuring that he would not be killed by day or night,
in or out of his house, on land or water, by God, man or beast. The
demon king then persecuted both gods and men, including his pious
son Prahlada, who was an ardent devotee of Vi�Qu. Prahlada was
subjected to a variety of cruelties and ordeals, but by the favour of
Vi�Qu he remained unscathed and preached with greater faith and
vigour the omnipresence, omniscience and omnipotence of Lord
Vi��u. In a fit of exasperation HiraJ?.ya Kasipu asked his son why, if
Vi�Qu was omnipresent, he could not see Him in the pillar of his
palace hall. The demon king contemptuously kicked the pillar to
convince his son of the absurdity of his faith. When Prahlada called
upon Vi�QU for help, the Lord burst from the pillar in a fearful form,
the top half being a lion and the lower half a man. It was then dusk,
when it was neither day nor night. The Lord lifted Hiral)ya Kasipu
in the air, seated Himself on the threshold, placed the demon king on
His thigh and tore him to pieces. Narasirpha Avatar is often depicted
in Indian sculpture and one such powerful group can be seen in the
Ellora caves.
There are two variations of this asana. The first, described in the
technique given below, follows the texts, whereas the second variation,
which is more strenuous to perform but which has greater beneficial
effects, is described later as Sirphasana I I . (Plate uo)
Technique

1. Sit on the floor, with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Raise the seat, bend the right knee and place the right foot under
the left buttock. Then bend the left knee and place the left foot under
the right buttock. The left ankle should be kept under the right one.

8. Gaze at the centre of the eyebrows or at the tip of the nose. Stay
in the pose for about 30 seconds, breathing through the mouth.
Withdraw the tongue into the mouth, lift the hands from the knees
and straighten the legs. Then repeat the pose, first placing the left foot
under the right buttock and then the right foot under the left buttock.

foul breath, the tongue becomes cleaner and words are enunciated
more clearly. It is, therefore, recommended to persons who stammer.
The asana relieves a painful coccyx and helps to set it when dis­
placed.
5 1 . Matsyasana Five* (Plate I I 3)

Matsya means a fish. This posture is dedicated to Matsya the Fish
Incarnation of Vi�I)U, the source and maintainer of the universe and
of all things. It is related that once upon a time the whole earth had
become corrupt and was about to be overwhelmed by a universal
flood. Vi�I).U took the form of a fish and warned Manu (the Hindu
Adam) of the impending disaster. The fish then carried Manu, his
family and the seven great sages in a ship, fastened to a horn on his
head. I t also saved the Vedas from the flood.

53· Garbha Pir:cfasana Seven* (Plate r r 6)

Garbha Pil)<;fa means an embryo in the womb (garbha = womb;
pinda
. = embryo). I n this variation of Padmasana, insert the hands and
arms in the space between the calves and thighs until the elbows are
bent. The arms are then bent up and the hands brought close to the
ears. The pose then resembles that of a human foetus in the womb, the
differences being that the embryo's head is down, while the legs are
up and not folded in Padmasana. The name of the posture indicates
that the ancient sages knew about the growth of the human foetus in
the mother's womb though the medical instruments at their disposal
were limited.

Technique
1 . Sit in Padmasana. (Plate 1 04)
2. Insert the hands in the space between the thighs and calves, each

on its own side.

3· Push the arms forwards till the elbows can be easily bent.

ing. Lower the legs, release the arms from between the legs one by
one, straighten the legs and relax.
6. Change the crossing of the legs and repeat the pose.
Effects
In this posture the abdominal organs are contracted completely and
the blood is made to circulate well round the organs. This keeps them
in trim.
54· Gorakfasana Ten* (Plate r 17)
Gorak�a means a cowherd. It is a difficult balancing pose and one feels
elated even if one can only balance for a few seconds.
Technique
r . Perform Padmasana (Plate 104), stretch the arms forward and place

them on the floor.
2. Rest on the hands and raise the hips from the floor.
3· Stretch the trunk up vertically and stand with the top part of the
knees on the floor.
4· Stretch the thighs and balance gradually by lifting the hands one by
one from the floor.
5· When balance is secured, fold the hands in front of the chest and
hold the position as long as you can. (Plate 1 17)
6. Place the hands on the floor, sit down and release the legs.
7. Change the leg position and repeat the pose for the same length
of time.
Effects
I n addition to the benefits of Padmasana (Plate 104), one achieves a
sense of balance. The coccyx (the tail bone) gets elasticity by the
practice of this pose.
55· Baddha Padmasana Six* (Plate I I 8)
Baddha means caught, restrained. In this position the hands are crossed
at the back and the big toes are caught from behind. The body is
caught between the crossed legs in front and the crossed hands behind,
hence the name.

4. If the toes are difficult to catch stretch the shoulders back, so that
the shoulder-blades are brought near each other. A little practice in

swinging the arms back with an exhalation will enable one to catch
the big toes.

If the right foot is placed first over the left thigh and then the
left foot over the right thigh, catch the left big toe first and then
the right big toe. If, on the other hand, the left foot is placed over the
right thigh first and rhen the right foot over the left thigh, catch
the right big toe first and then the left big toe. Catch first the big toe
of the foot which is uppermost.

This asana is especially useful in awakening Ku�9alini
8. Also move the head on to the right and left knees alternately with
an exhalation. (Plates 121 and 122)
Effects

Crossing the hands behind the back expands the chest and increases
the range of shoulder movements. Yoga Mudrasana (Plate 1 20)
intensifies the peristaltic activity and pushes down the accumulated
waste matter in the colon and thereby relieves constipation and increases
digestive power.

toes, uncross the hands at the back and sit up again in Padmasana.
(Plate 104.) Then straighten the legs and relax.
6. Change the leg position and repeat the pose.
Effects

The dorsal region is fully extended in this posture and so the chest is
expanded fully. Due to the stretch of the neck the thyroids benefit
by the exercise. The pelvic joints become elastic. Once the pose 1s
mastered, Matsyasana (Plate 1 1 3) will appear to be child's play.

10. Repeat on the other side, keeping the left leg straight and the

right one bent for an equal length of time.
Effects

This asana tones the abdominal organs, the kidneys and adrenal
glands. Women suffering from a prolapsed womb find relief as it pulls
the womb up to its original position. Persons suffering from spleen
ailments and from enlargement of the prostate gland will benefit by
staying in this pose longer. I t cures indigestion.
'This Mahamudra destroys death and many other pains.' 'There is
nothing that one cannot eat or has to avoid (if one has practised it).
All food regardless of taste and even when deadly poisonous is
digested.' 'He who practises Mahamudra, overcomes consumption,
leprosy, piles, enlargement of the spleen, indigestion and other com­
plaints of long duration.' (Hatha Yoga Pradfpika, chapter 3 , verses 14,
1 6 and 17.)

turn the left forearm and the left wrist so that the left thumb points
to the floor. With the left hand catch the inner side of the left foot,
bring the right arm over the head and catch the outer side of the left
foot near the heel. Then rest the back of the head on the left knee
and try to touch the inner side of the left knee with the back of the
left shoulder so that the back of the left side ribs rests on the left knee
and stretch the right side of the ribs. Remain on this side for the same
length of time.
Effects

In addition to the effects stated in the note on Janu S'ir�asana (Plate I27),
this pose stimulates the blood circulation to the spine and relieves backaches. In Janu Sfr�asana the abdominal organs are contracted, here they
are stretched on both sides. This is a very invigorating pose.
•

6 1 . Ardha Baddha Padma Paschimottanasana Eight* (Plate I 35)

Ardha means half, baddha means caught, restrained and padma a lotus.
Paschimottanasana (Plate I 6o) is the posture where the back of the whole
body is intensely stretched.
Technique

I . Sit on the floor, with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the left leg at the knee, and place the left foot over the right
thigh. The left heel should press the navel and the toes should be
stretched and pointing. This is the half lotus posture.
3 · Bring the left arm round the back from behind and with an exhalation
catch the big toe of the left foot. If the toe cannot be grasped easily,
swing back the left shoulder.
4· After holding the left big toe, move the bent left knee nearer to the
extended right leg. Stretch the right arm forward and catch the right foot
with the right hand, the palm touching the sole. (Plates I33 and I 34)

I I . If you cannot hold the toe with the hand from behind, hold the

extended leg with both hands and follow the above technique. (Plates
136 and 1 37)

1 37

Effects

Due to the half lotus pose, the knees become flexible enough to execute
the full lotus pose. While placing the chin on the knee of the extended
leg, the bent knee is brought close to the stretched leg. This gives a good
pull to the navel and abdominal organs. Blood is made to flow round
the navel and the genital organs. The navel is considered to be a nerve
centre, and the Svadhi�!hana Chakra, one of the purificatory fly-wheels

I 56

Light on Yoga

in the human nervous system, is situated there. This chakra corresponds
to the hypo-gastric plexus. The pose is recommended for persons with
rounded and drooping shoulders.
62. Trianga Mukhaikapda Paschimottanasana Five* (Plate 139)

Trianga means three limbs or parts thereof. In this posture the three
parts are the feet, knees and buttocks. Mukhaikapada (a compound of
three words, mukha = face, eka = one, and pada = leg or foot) corresponds
to the face (or mouth) touching one (extended) leg. In Paschimot­
tanasana (Plate r 6o) the back of the whole body is intensely stretched.
Technique

1 . Sit on the floor, with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the right leg at the knee and move the right foot back. Place the

right foot by the side of the right hip joint, keep the toes pointing back
and rest them on the floor. The inner side of the right calf will touch the
outer side of the right thigh.
3· Balance in this position, throwing the weight of the body on the bent
knee. In the beginning, the body tilts to the side of the outstretched leg,
and the foot of the outstretched leg also tilts outwards. Learn to balance
in this position, keeping the foot and toes stretched and pointing
forward.
4· Now hold the left foot with both the palms, gripping the sides of the

sole. If you can, then extend the trunk forward and hook the wrists
round the outstretched left foot. (Plate 138.) Take two deep breaths. It
usually takes several months before one can hook the wrists in this way,
so do not despair after the first few attempts.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriyii

5· Join the knees, exhale and bend forward. Rest first the forehead, then
the nose, next the lips and ultimately the chin on the left knee. (Plate
139.) To achieve this, widen the elbows and push the trunk forward
with an exhalation.
6. Do not rest the left elbow on the floor. In the beginning, one loses
balance and topples over to the side of the extended leg. The trunk
should, therefore, be slightly bent towards the side of the bent leg and
the weight of the body should be taken by the bent knee.
7. Stay in this position from half a minute to a minute, breathing
evenly.
Inhale, raise the head and trunk, release the hands, straighten the
right leg and come to position 1.
8.

9· Repe.1t the pose on the other side, keeping the right leg stretched
out on the ground, bending the left knee and placing the left foot by the
left hip joint. Stay for the same length of time on both sides.
Effects

This asana is recommended for persons suffering from dropped arches
and fiat feet. It cures sprains in the ankle and the knee, and any swelling
in the leg is reduced:
Along with Janu Sfr�asana (Plate 127) and Ardha Baddha Padma
Paschimottanasana (Plate 135), this asana tones the abdominal organs
and keeps them free from sluggishness. We abuse our abdominal organs
by over-indulgence or by conforming to social etiquette. Abdominal
organs cause a majority of diseases and ancient sages emphasised that
their health was essential for longevity, happiness and peace of mind.
These forward bending asanas keep the abdominal organs healthy and
in trim. Apart from keeping the muscles in shape, they work on the
organs as well.

63. Krounchasana Ten* (Plates 141 and 142)

Krouncha means a heron. It is also the name of a mountain, said to be
the grandson of Himalaya and to have been pierced by Kartikeya, the
god of war, and by Parasurama, the sixth incarnation of Vi�J?.u. In this
sitting posture, one leg is bent back at the knee and the foot is placed
against the side ofthe hip joint, while the other leg is raised up vertically,
its foot being held by the hands. The chin is then placed on the knee of
the vertical leg. The raised leg resembles the outstretched neck and
head of a heron, also a precipice. Hence the name.
Technique

1. Sit on the floor, with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the right leg at the knee and move the right foot back. Place the
right foot by the side of the hip joint, keep the toes pointing back and
rest all of them on the floor. The inner side of the right calf will touch
the outer side of the right thigh. Join the knees together.
3· Exhale, bend the left knee, hold the left foot with both hands and
raise the left leg up vertically. (Plate 140)

140
4 · Stretch out the left leg fully and keep the back erect. After a few
breaths in this position, exhale, move the head and trunk forward and
at the same time try and bring the left leg nearer and rest the chin on
the knee of the left leg. (Plates 141 and 142)

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

159

5 · Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds, with deep breaths. Do not
lift the bent knee off the floor while the chin is touching the knee of the
lifted leg.
6. Inhale, move the head and trunk back (Plate 140), lower the left leg,
release the hands, bring the right leg straight forward and return to
position r .
7 · Repeat the pose on the other side, bending the left knee and placing

141

142

the left foot by the left hip joint and raising the right leg up. Stay for an
equal length of time on this side also.
Effects

The pose can be done as a continuation of Triang Mukhaikapada
Paschimottanasana (Plate 139). I t is harder to do than Paschimot­
tanasana (Plate 160) and therefore its effects are greater. I t gives a full
extension to the leg and exercises the muscles of the legs. The abdominal
organs are also rejuvenated.
64. Marzchyasana I Five* (Plate 144)
This asana is dedicated to the sage Mar!chi, son of the Creator, Brahma.
Mar!chi was the grandfather of Siirya (the Sun God).

Technique
I.

Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)

2. Bend the left knee and place the sole and heel of the left foot flat on

the floor. The shin of the left leg should be perpendicular to the floor
and the calf should touch the thigh. Place the left heel near the perineum.
The innt.r side of the left foot should touch the inner side of the out­
stretched right thigh.
3· Stretch the left shoulder forward till the left armpit touches the per­
pendicular left shin. Turn the left arm round the left shin and thigh,
bend the left elbow and throw the left forearm behind the back at the
level of the waist. Then move the right hand behind the back and clasp
the left hand with the right at the wrist or vice versa. If that is not possible
then clasp the palms or the fingers. (Plate 143)
4· Now, turn the spine to the left, keeping the outstretched right leg

1 43

straight . Remain in this position gazing at the outstretched right big toe
and take a few deep breaths.
5· Exhale, and bend forward. Rest the forehead, then the nose, next the
lips and lastly the chin on the right knee. (Plate 144.) While in this
position, keep both shoulders parallel to the floor and breathe normally.
Stay in the pose for about 30 seconds and see that the back of the entire
extended leg rests on the floor throughout.
6. Inhale, raise the head from the right knee (Plate I43), release the
hands, straighten the left leg and come to position I .
7· Repeat the pose on the other side for an equal length of time.
Effects

The fingers gain in strength by . the practice of this asana. In the pre­
ceding asanas (namely, Janu Slr�asana (Plate 127), Ardha Baddha
Padma Paschimottanasana (Plate I 35) and Triang Mukhaikapada Paschi­
mottanasana (Plate 139) the abdominal organs are made to contract by
gripping a leg with the hands. In this pose the hands do not hold the
legs. To bend forward and to rest the chin on the knee of the extended
leg the abdominal organs have to contract vigorously. This creates a
better circulation of blood round the abdominal organs and keeps them
healthy. In the beginning it is very difficult to bend forward at all after
gripping both hands behind the back, but it comes with practice. The
dorsal region of the spine i� also exercised in this pose.
Note. The four poses, Janu Slr�asana, Ardha Baddha Padma Paschimot­
tanasana, Triang Mukhaikapada Paschimottanasana and Marlchyasana
I, are preparatory poses for the correct Paschimottanasana. (Plate 161.)
It is difficult for many to get a good grip on the feet in Paschimottanasana
(Plate 160) even after several attempts. These four asanas give one
sufficient elasticity in the back and legs so that one gradually achieves
the correct Paschimottanasana (Plate I6I) as described later. Once this
is done with ease, these four asanas can be practised once or twice a
week instead of daily.
65. Marzchyasana II Six* (Plates 1 46 and 147)
Technique
1. Sit on the floor, with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)

2. Bend the left leg at the knee and place the left foot at the root of the
right thigh. The left heel should press the navel and the toes be stretched
and pointing. The left leg is now in half Padmasana.
3· Bend the right leg at the knee. Place the sole and heel of the right foot
flat on the floor. Keep the shin of the right leg perpendicular, so that

162

Light on Yoga

the right thigh and the right calf touch each other and the right heel
touches the perineum.
4 · Bend slightly forward, stretch the right shoulder forward until the
right armpit touches the perpendicular right shin. With an exhalation,
curl the right arm round the right shin and thigh, bend the right elbow
and turn the right forearm behind the back at the level of the waist.
Then move the left hand behind the back and clasp the right hand with
the left at the wrist. (Plate 145)

145
5· Stretch the spine up and hold this position for a few seconds, breath­
ing deeply.
6. Exhale, move the trunk and head forward and rest the head on the
bent left knee. Then extend the neck and rest the chin on the left knee.
(Plates 146 and 147.) Repeat this movement three or four times, inhaling
while coming up and exhaling while going down.
7· Inhale, move the head and trunk up, release the hands, straighten
the legs, and then repeat the pose on the other side for the same length
of time.
Effects

As this pose is an intensified form of Mar1chyasana I (Plate 144), its
effects are greater. The heel at the navel puts extra pressure on the
abdomen so that the abdominal organs are toned better and grow
stronger and digestive power increases.

Effects

The asana stretches the hamstrings and helps the blood to circulate
properly in the pelvic region and keeps it healthy. It prevents the
development of hernia of which it can cure mild cases and relieves sciatic
pains. Since the asana controls and regularises the menstrual flow and
also stimulates the ovaries, it is a boon to women.

(Also called Ugrasana or Brahmacharyasana)
Paschima literally means the west. It implies the back of the whole body
from the head to the heels. The anterior or eastern aspect is the front
of the body from the face down to the toes. The crown of the head is
the upper or northern aspect while the soles and heels of the feet form
the lower or southern aspect of the body. I n this asana the back of the
whole body is intensely stretched, hence the name.
Ugra means formidable, powerful and noble. Brahmacharya means
religious study, self-restraint and celibacy.

Effects

This asana tones the abdominal organs and keeps them free from
sluggishness. It also tones the kidneys, rejuvenates the whole spine and
improves the digestion.
The spines of animals are horizontal and their hearts are below the
spine. This keeps them healthy and gives them great power of endur­
ance. In humans the spine is vertical and the heart is not lower than the
spine, so that they soon feel the effects of exertion and are also susceptible
to the heart diseases. In Paschimottanasana the spine is kept straight and
horizontal and the heart is at a lower level than the spine. A good stay
in this pose massages the heart, the spinal column and the abdominal
organs, which feel refreshed and the mind is rested. Due to the extra
stretch given to the pelvic region more oxygenated blood is brought there
and the gonad glands absorb the required nutrition from the blood. This
increases vitality, helps to cure impotency and leads to sex control.
Hence, this asana was called Brahmacharyasana. Brahmacharya means
celibacy and a Brahmachari is one who has controlled the sex appetite.

4 · Exhale, twist the trunk about 90 degrees to the left by bending and
widening the elbows. (Plate 164.) Take a breath. Exhale again, move
the head between the arms and look up. The back portion of the upper
right arm near the armpit will rest across the left knee. Try and rest
the right side ribs on the left thigh. (Front view : Plate r6s. Back view :

free from sluggishness. I t also tones the kidneys and rejuvenates the
entire spine, while the digestion is improved. The lateral twist stimulates
blood circulation in the spine and relieves backaches. Due to the stretch
of the pelvic region, more oxygenated blood is brought there and the

gonad glands absorb the required nutrition from the blood. This in­
creases vitality, helps to cure impotency and promotes sex control.
69. Urdhva Mukha PaschimottO.niisana I Ten* (Plate 168)
Urdhva (upwards) and Mukha (face, mouth) when used together mean
having the face upwards. Paschimottanasana is the intense posterior
stretch.
Technique
1. Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Flex the knees and bring the feet closer to the buttocks.
3· Catch the toes with the hands, exhale and stretch the legs up in the
air, straighten them at the knees, pull the knee-caps towards the thighs
and balance on the buttocks, keeping the spine as concave as you can.
This position is called:
70. Ubhaya Padangu�fhiisana Three* (Plate 167)
(Ubhaya = both, padangu�!ha =big toe)
To stan with one rolls over backwards to the floor, and it takes some
time and practice to learn to balance on the buttocks alone. Stay in the
pose from 30 to 6o seconds with normal breathing.

4· After securing the balance, release the toes and hold the heels.
5· When this becomes easy, interlock the fingers behind the extended
feet and balance. Then without disturbing the position of the legs, move
the head and trunk nearer to them, stretch the neck up and with an
exhalation rest the forehead on the knees. (Plate 168.) Now stretch the
legs up to the full extent and also the spine. Hold the pose for about
30 seconds with normal breathing.

Light on Yoga

Effects
The pose helps balance and poise. The legs stretch fully which makes
the thighs and calves shapely. The benefits are the same as those of
Paschimottanasana (Plate 160), and in addition this pose prevents hernia
and relieves severe backaches.
72. Purvottanasana One* (Plate 171)
Piirva literally means the East. It means the front of the whole body
from the forehead to the toes. Uttana means an intense stretch. In this
posture, the whole front of the body is stretched intensely.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. Place the
palms on the floor by the hips, with the fingers pointing in the direc­
tion of the feet. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the knees and place the soles and heels on the floor.
3· Take the pressure of the body on the hands and feet, exhale and
lift the body off the floor. Straighten the arms and the legs and keep
the knees and elbows tightened. (Plate 171)

171
4· The arms will be perpendicular to the floor from the wrists to the
shoulders. From the shoulders to the pelvis, the trunk will be parallel
to the floor.
5· Stretch the neck and throw the head as far back as possible.
6. Stay in this posture for one minute, breathing normally.
7· Exhale, bend the elbows and knees, lower the body to sit on the
floor and relax.

Effects
This posture strengthens the wrists and ankles, improves the movement
of the shoulder joints and expands the chest fully. It gives relief from
the fatigue caused by doing other strenuous forward bending asanas.
-

73· Akarr;a Dhanuriisana Eleven* (Plates 173 and 175)
Karf)a means the ear. The prefix a expresses the sense of near to,
towards. Dhanu means a bow. In this posture, the left foot is pulled
up till the heel touches the ear as an archer pulls the bow-string, while
the other hand holds the right big toe, this leg lying straight on the
floor. In the second movement the raised leg is straightened up until
it is almost perpendicular, the big toe being held throughout by the
hand like an extended bow.
The asana is given below in two movements.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Hold the right big toe between the right thumb and the index and
middle fingers. Similarly hold the left big toe. (Plate 153)
3· Exhale, bend the left elbow and lift the left foot up by bending
the knee. (Plate 172.) Take a breath. Now exhale and pull the left foot
up until the heel is close to the left ear. At the same time draw the
left arm back from the shoulder. (Plate 173.) Do not let go of the
right big toe. Keep the right leg extended throughout and see that the
back of the entire leg rests on the floor. The extended right leg should
not bend at the knee.

178

Light on Yoga

173
4· Hold this position from 15 to 20 seconds with normal breathing.
This is the first movement.
5· Now exhale and stretch the left leg up vertically. (Plate 174.) Take
a breath. Exhale, draw the leg further back until it touches the left
ear. (Plate 17 5 . ) Continue to grip the toes of both feet and fully extend
both legs. Do not bend them at the knees. It takes some time to learn
to balance in this second movement. Remain in this position from 10
to I 5 seconds, breathing normally.

1 74

6. Exhale, bend the left leg at the knee and bring the left heel to the
left ear as in position 3 above. (Plate 173.) Then lower the left leg
to the floor and keep both legs stretched on the floor. (Plate 1 53)

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

179

7. Repeat the pose on the right side, pulling the right foot towards
the right ear and raising it up vertically near the right ear, while keep­
ing the left leg straight on the floor. Do not relax the hand grip of the
toes. Maintain the position on both sides for an equal length of time.
Then release the hands and relax.
Effects
The practice of this posture makes the leg muscles very flexible. The
abdominal muscles are contracted and this helps to move the bowels.
Minor deformities in the hip joints are adjusted. The lower portion of
the spine is exercised. The pose is full of grace. It should be practised
until it comes effortlessly and gives the appearance of a trained archer
discharging arrows from his bow.
74· Scdamba Sir�asana I Four* (Plates 184, 185 and 1 90)
Salamba means with support. Slrsa means the head. This is the head
stand pose, one of the most important Yogic asanas. It is the basic
posture. I t has several variations, which are described later as the
Slr�asana cycle. Its mastery gives one balance and poise, both physic­
ally and mentally. The technique of doing it is given at length in two
parts ; the first is for beginners, the second for those who can remain
�alanced in the pose. Attention is specially directed to the hints on
Sfrsasana given after the two techniques.
Technique for beginners
1.

Spread a blanket fourfold on the floor and kneel near it.

1 8o

Light on Yoga

Rest the forearms on the centre of the blanket. While doing so take
care that the distance between the elbows on the floor is not wider
than the shoulders.

2.

!76
3· Interlock the fingers right up to the finger-tips (Plate 176), so that the
palms form a cup. Place the sides of the palms near the little fingers on
the blanket. While going up on to your head or balancing, the fingers
should be kept tightly locked. If they are left loose, the weight of the
body falls on them and the arms ache. So remember to lock them well.

177
4· Rest the crown of the head only on the blanket, so that the back
of the head touches the palms which are cupped. (Plate 177.) Do not
rest the forehead nor the back but only the crown of the head on the
blanket. To do this move the knees towards the head.
After securing the head position, raise the knees from the floor by
moving the toes closer to the head. (Plate 178)
5·

6. Exhale, take a gentle swing from the floor and lift the legs off the
ground with bent knees. (Plate 179.) Take the swing in such a way
that both feet leave the floor simultaneously. When once this position
is secured, follow the various stages of the leg movements as in Plates
1 80, 1 8 1 , 182 and 183, step by step.

182

Stretch the legs and stand on the head, keeping the whole body
perpendicular to the floor. (Front view : Plate 184. Back view : Plate
185. Side view : Plate 190)
7.

8. After staying in the final position to capacity, from one to five
minutes, flex the knees and slide down to the floor in the reverse order
as in Plates 183, 182, 1 8 1 , 180, 179, 178 and 177.
9· A beginner must have the assistance of a friend or do the asana
against a wall. While practising against a wall, the distance between
it and the head should not be more than 2 or 3 inches. If the distance
is greater, the spine will curve and the stomach will protrude. Tr.�
weight of the body will be felt on the elbows and the position of the
head may change. The face will appear to be flushed and the eyes
either strained or puffed. It is, therefore, advisable for a beginner to
do the head stand in a corner where two walls meet, placing the head
some 2 to 3 inches from either wall.
10. While doing the head stand against a wall or in a corner, the
beginner should exhale, swing the legs up, support the hips against
the side of the wall and move the feet up. In a corner, he can touch
the heels tv either side of the walls. He should then stretch the back
vertically up, gradually leave the support of the wall and learn to

YogCisanas, Bandha and Kriya

183

185
master the balance. While coming down, he can rest the feet and hips
against the wall, slide down and kneel, resting his knees on the floor.
The movements of coming down and going up should be done with
an exhalation.
I I . The advantage which the beginner has of balancing in a comer is
that his head and legs will be in the right angle formed by the walls,
and he will be sure of his right position. This will not be the case if
he balances against a straight wall. For while his balance is insecure
he may sway from the wall, or his body may tilt or swing to the
stronger side, while his legs may rest against the wall with a bend either
at the waist or the hips. The beginner will not be in a position to
know that he has tilted to one side, much less to correct it. In time
he may learn to balance on the head, but by habit his body may still
tilt or his head may not be straight. It is as hard to correct a wrong
pose in the head stand as it is to break a bad habit. Moreover this
wrong posture may well lead to aches and pains in the head, neck,
shoulders and back. But the two walls of a corner will help the
beginner to keep the asana symmetrical.
I 2. When once balance is secured, it is advisable to come down to
the floor with the legs straight (that is, without bending the knees

I 84

Light on Yoga

at all) and with a backward action of the hips. At first, it is not pos­
sible to go up and come down without bending the legs, but the
correct method should be learnt. Once the beginner has confidence in
the head stand, he will find it more beneficial to go up and down with
the legs together and straight, without any jerks.
I 3· It takes time for the beginner to become oriented to his surround­
ings while he is balancing on his head. Everything will seem at first
to be completely unfamiliar. The directions and instructions will
appear confusing and he will find it an effort to think clearly or to act
logically. This is due to fear of a fall. The best way to overcome fear
is to face with equanimity the situation of which one is afraid. Then
one gets the correct perspective, and one is not frightened any more.
To topple over while learning the head stand is not as terrible as we
imagine. If one overbalances, one should remember to loosen the inter­
locked fingers, relax, go limp and flex the knees. Then one will just
roll over and smile. I f the fingers are not loosened they will take the
jerk of the fall which will be painful. If we do not relax and go limp
while falling we hit the floor with a hard bump. If we flex the knees,
we are unlikely to graze them in the fall. After one has learnt to
balance against a wall or in a corner, one should try the head stand
in the middle of the room. There will be a few spills and one must
learn the art of falling as indicated above. Learning to do S'ir�asana
in the middle of a room gives the beginner great confidence.
Technique for those who can balance Eight*
1 . Follow the technique described for beginners from positions I to 4·
2. After securing the head position, stretch the legs straight by raising
the knees from the floor. Move the toes nearer to the head and try to
press the heels to the floor, keeping the back erect. (Plate I 86)
3· Stretch the dorsal or middle region of the spine and stay in this
position for about 30 seconds while breathing evenly.
4· Exhale, raise the heels and take the toes off the floor with a back­
ward movement of the hips. Raise both legs simultaneously, keeping
them poker stiff. (Plate I 87.) Take a breath.
5. Again with an exhalation move the legs up until they are parallel
to the floor. This position is called :
75· Urdhva Dandasana Eight* (Plate I 88)
(Urdhva = up, dai_l�a = a staff)
Stay in this position for 1 0 seconds with normal breathing.

to the vertical position. (Side view : Plate 190.) Stay in this pose from
I to 5 minutes while breathing evenly.

189

190

7. Come down gradually, observing the above technique in a reverse
order. (Plates r89, I88, I 87 and r86.) Rest the feet on the floor, bend

the knees and raise the head from the floor or blanket.

8. While coming down, it is advisable to stay in Ordhva Da��asana

according to capacity up to one minute while breathing normally. In
this position, the neck and trunk will not be perpendicular to the floor
but will sway slightly backwards. The neck, shoulders and spine will
be put to a very great strain and in the initial stages one cannot stay
with the legs parallel to the floor for more than a few seconds. The
stay will become longer as the neck, shoulders, abdomen and spine
become stronger.
Hinrs on Szrsasana
.

In Sir�asana the balance alone is not important. One has to watch
from moment to moment and find out the subtle adjustments. When
we stand on our feet, we need no extra effort, strength or attention,
for the position is natural. Yet the correct method of standing affects
our bearing and carriage. It is, therefore, necessary to master the correct
i
method as pointed out in the note on Ta�asma. In Sir�asana also,
the correct position should be mastered, as a faulty posture in this asana
will lead to pains in the head, neck and back.
r.

Yogiisanas, Bandha and Kriyli

2. The whole weight of the body should be borne on the head alone
and not on the forearms and hands. The forearms and hands are to
be used only for support to check any loss of balance. In a good pose
you feel a circle, about the size of an Indian rupee, of the head in
contact with the blanket on the floor.
3· The back of the head, the trunk, the back of the thighs and the
heels should be in a line perpendicular to the floor and not inclined
to one side. The throat, chin and breast-bone should be in one line,
otherwise the head will tilt to one side or move forward. As regards
the interlocked hands behind the head, the palms should not be stuck
into the head. The upper and the lower sides of the palms should be
in a line, otherwise the crown of the head will not rest on the floor
correctly.
4· The elbows and the shoulders should be in a line and the elbows
should not be widened. The shoulders should be kept as high above
the floor as possible by moving them up and stretching them sideways.
In order to learn the correct shoulder stretch, release the interlocked
fingers and remove the hands from behind the head and widen the
wrists from the forearms, keeping the elbows stationary. Place the wrists
on the floor with the palms facing up, touch the shoulders with the
fingers, keeping the wrists on the floor and maintain the balance. (Plate
191.) This will not only improve the balance but also prepare you for
the other Sir�asana poses described later.

191

188

Light on Yoga

5· As to the position of the trunk, the dorsal region should be pushed
forward as well as up. The lumbar (waist) and pelvic regions should
not be pushed forward, while the trunk from the shoulders to the
pelvis should be kept perpendicular. If the pelvic area juts forward, it
means that you are bearing the weight of the body not on the head
alone but also on the elbows for you have not stretched the dorsal
region (the chest) correctly. When viewed from the side, the body from
the neck to the heels should appear straight.
6. As far as possible try and join the thighs, knees, ankles and toes.
Stretch the legs fully, especially the back of the knees and thighs. If
the legs swing back tighten the knees and the lower median portion
of the abdomen above the pubes. This will keep the legs perpendicular.
Keep the toes pointing up. If the legs swing forward, stretch the
dorsal region and push the pelvic area slightly back until it is in line
with the shoulders. The body will then feel light and the pose will be
exhilarating.
While going up or holding the head stand the eyes should never
become bloodshot. I f they do, the pose is faulty.1
7·

8. The time limit for S!r�asana depends upon individual capacity and
the time at one's disposal. One can hold i t comfortably from 1 0 to 1 5
minutes. A beginner can do it for 2 minutes and go up to 5 minutes.
It is always difficult for a beginner to balance for one minute, but once
he succeeds he can be sure that from then on he will be able to master
S!rsasana
soon.
.
9· While going up or coming down, move both legs together, inch by
inch. All the movements should be done with exhalation. Inhale while
waiting in a position. The effect of going down and coming up straight
without bending the legs at the knees is that harmonious slow move­
ment is gained and the flow of blood to the head is controlled. The
face does not flush from jerky and fast movements, as the flow of blood
to the waist and the legs is also controlled. Then there is no danger
of losing balance from giddiness or numbness of the feet when one
stands up immediately after the head balance. In course of time the
whole movement of going up, staying and coming down should become
as effortless as possible. In a perfect Sfr�asana your body feels completely
stretched and at the same time you experience a feeling of complete
relaxation.
1 I have taught this pose to a lady of 65 who was suffering from glaucoma.

Now she finds the eyes are completely rested and the pain in them is much
lessened. Medical examination revealed that the tension in the eyeballs had
decreased. I am mentioning this to prove the value of the correct head stand.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

IO. It is always safe to perfect Sarvangasana (Plate 223) first before
attempting S'ir�asana. If the standing poses described earlier (Plates
I to 36) and the various movements of Sarvangasana and Halasana
(Plates 234 to 27I) are mastered first, Si"rsasana will come without much
effort. If these elementary asanas have not been mastered, the period
taken to learn Si"r�asana will be longer.
'

I 1 . After one has learnt to balance in S'irsasana, however, it is prefer­
able to perform S'ir�asana and its cycle (Plates I90 to 2 I 8) first before
practising any other asana. This is because one cannot balance or
hold the head stand if the body is exhausted by doing other poses
or if the breathing becomes fast and shaky. Once the body is tired or
the breathing is not free and easy, the body will shake and it will be
difficult to maintain the balance. It is always better to do S'ir�asana
first when one is fresh.
'

I2. Si'r�asana and its cycle should always be followed by Sarvangasana
and its cycle. I t has been observed that people who devote themselves
to Si'r�asana alone without doing the Sarvangasana poses are apt to lose
their temper over trifling things and become irritated quickly. The
checks this trait. If
practice of Sarvangasana coupled with Si'rsasana
.
Sarvangasana is the Mother, then Si'r�asana may be regarded as the
Father of all asanas. And just as both parents are necessary for peace and
harmony in a home, so the practice of both these asanas is essential to
keep the body healthy and the mind tranquil and peaceful.

Effects of Sir�asana
I

The ancient books have called Si'r�asana the king of all asanas and the
reasons are not hard to find. When we are born, normally the head comes
out first and then the limbs. The skull encases the brain, which controls
the nervous system and the organs of sense. The brain is the seat of
intelligence, knowledge, discrimination, wisdom and power. It is the
seat of Brahman, the soul. A country cannot prosper without a proper
king or constitutional head to guide it; so also the human body cannot
prosper without a healthy brain.
The Bhagavad-Gita says : 'Harmony (sattva), mobility (rajas), inertia
(tamas), such are the qualities, matter-born; they bind fast, 0 great
armed one (Arjuna), the indestructible dweller in the body.' (Fourteenth
Discourse, verse 5.) All these qualities stem from the brain, and some­
times one quality prevails and sometimes the others. The head is the
centre of sattvic qualities which control discrimination; the trunk of
Rajasic qualities which control passion, emotion and actions; and the
region below the diaphragm of tamasic qualities which control sensual

190

Light on Yoga

pleasures like the enjoyment of food and drink, and the thrills and
pleasures of sex.
Regular practice of Sfr�asana makes healthy pure blood flow through
the brain cells. This rejuvenates them so that thinking power increases
and thoughts become clearer. The asana is a tonic for people whose
brains tire quickly. I t ensures a proper blood supply to the pituitary and
pineal glands in the brain. Our growth, health and vitality depend on the
proper functioning of these two glands.
People suffering from loss of sleep, memory and vitality have re­
covered by the regular and correct practice of this asana and have
become fountains of energy. The lungs gain the power to resist any
climate and stand up to any work, which relieves one from colds, coughs,
tonsillitis, halitosis (foul breath) and palpitations. It keeps the body
warm. Coupled with Sarvangasana movements (Plates 234 to 27 1 ), it is
a boon to people suffering from constipation. Regular practice of
Sfr�asana will show marked improvement in the haemoglobin content
of the blood.
.
It is not advisable to start with Sfr�asana and Sarvangasana when one
suffers from high or low blood pressure.
Regular and precise practice of S'ir�asana develops the body, dis­
ciplines the mind and widens the horizons of the spirit. One becomes
balanced and self-reliant in pain and pleasure, loss and gain, shame and
fame and defeat and victory.

6. While the legs are going up to the perpendicular, the neck bears the
weight of the body and feels the strain. Move the legs up until you feel
lightness on the back of the neck and forearms and stretch the dorsal
region of the trunk forward. When you feel the lightness, be sure that
t.he body is straight. Follow the technique and hints given for Sa1amba
Slrsasana
I for those who can balance.
.
7· Remain erect in the head stand for a minute. Then exhale, draw
the hips slightly back without lifting the elbows and gently lower the
legs to the floor. Try to keep the legs straight and do not bend them
at the knees while lowering them.
79· Mukta Hasta Si'rfasana Six* (Plates 200 and 201)
Mukta means free. Hasta means hand. This is the most difficult varia­
tion of S'ir�asana to master. When it comes comfortably, one is a perfect
master of the head stand. It is comparatively easy to balance in this
asana, but it is extremely difficult to go up and come down keeping the
the legs straight without bending them at the knees.
Technique
1 . Spread a balanket fourfold on the floor and kneel near it.

2. Bend the trunk forward and rest the crown of the head on the
blanket.
3· Stretch the arms straight out in front of the chest towards the feet
and rest the back of the wrists on the floor. Keep the arms straight
at the elbows with the palms up. The distance between the wrists
should be the same as that between the shoulders.
4· Raise the trunk until it is perpendicular to the floor. Press the
wrists gently against the floor, exhale and raise the feet. (Plate 199.)
Tighten the legs and slowly raise them up until they are perpendicular.

7· Then lift the head up from the floor, sit down and relax.
Note. Once mastery over the variations of S'ir�asana is secured, It IS
possible to change the position of the hands while balancing on the
head only. One need not then come down again to change the position
of the hands. One should learn this gradually, otherwise one is apt to
strain the neck and shoulders.
8o. Par5va Si"r�asana Eight* (Plates 202 and 203)
Parsva means side or flank. In this variation of Sir�asana, the trunk
and legs are turned sideways on either side while balancing without
disturbing the position of the head or hands.
Technique
r. From the straight Salamba S'ir�asana I (Plate 1 84), exhale and move

the spine with a twist to the right ; except the head and the hands turn
the body sideways. (Front view : Plate 202. Back view : Plate 203)
2. The legs and navel should face sideways 90 degrees to their original
positions as in the illustrations. One should feel the stretch near the
region of the floating ribs.

8 1 . Parivrttaikapada Sir�asana Ten* (Plates 205, 206 and 207)
Parivrtta means revolved, turned round. Eka means one and pada the
leg. In this variation of Si'r�asana, the legs are spread apart and the trunk
and legs are then turned sideways on either side, while maintaining the
balance without disturbing the position of the head or the hands.

hamstring muscles, knees and calves.
3· Spread the legs still wider and stay in that position from 20 to 30

seconds trying to breathe normally.
4· Exhale, come to the straight Salamba Si'r�asana I. Now, move the left
leg forward and the right leg back, twist the spine to the right so that
the legs move sideways anti-clockwise through 90 degrees. (Front view :

82. Eka Pada StrfO.Sana Eleven* (Plates 208 and 209)
.

Eka means one. Pada is the leg. This variation of Si'r�asana is done by
lowering one leg to the floor in front of the head, holding the other leg
up vertically.

Technique
.

1 . After staying according to your capacity in Salamba Si'r�asana I,
exhale, and move the right leg down to the floor in front of the head.
(Side view : Plate 208)
2. While the right leg is being lowered and is resting on the floor, the
left leg should be held up vertically as in Si'r�asana.
3· In the beginning, the neck feels tremendous strain. The left leg is
also dragged down forwards. To overcome this, keep the legs rigid at the

Yogiisanas, Bandha and Kriya

201

knees and stretch the muscles at the back of the thighs of both the legs.
Also tighten the muscles of the lower median portion of the abdomen.
4· The knees and toes of both legs should be in a line and should not
tilt sideways.

209
208
5· Stay in the pose from 10 to 20 seconds with deep breathing. Exhale,
and lift the right leg up to Sir�asana.
'

.

6. After staying in Sir�asana for some time, lower the left leg to the
floor (Front view : Plate 209) and after kec:ping it on the floor for the
same length of time, exhale and go back to Si'r�asana.
7· While lowering and raising the legs, keep them straight and do not
bend at the knees. If the knees are bent one loses the head balance.

Effects
This is a difficult pose, so it may not be possible to touch the floor in
the beginning. Gradually as the legs become more elastic and the back
gets stronger, the legs will touch and then rest on the floor without loss
of the head balance. This asana strengthens the neck and also the
abdominal walls. The abdominal organs are contracted and made to
function well.

83. Parsvaika Pada Slrfasana Twelve* (Plate 2 1 0)

Pariva means sideways. Eka is one and pada is the leg. In this pose, one
leg is lowered to the floor sideways in line with the head, while the other
leg remains vertically up.
Techn que
i
1 . Do this position after completing Eka Pada S'irsasana (Plates 208 and
209) as described earlier.
•

2. Exhale and lower the right leg sideways to the right, placing it on
t;he floor in line with the head. (Plate 210.) Keep the left leg erect as in

Slrsasana.
•

210

It is m�re difficult to hold the head stand in this position than in
Eka Pada Slr�asana. To balance on the head in this pose, stretch the
muscles at the back of the thighs of both the legs, tighten the knees and
muscles of the groin in the iliac region of the abdomen on the side of
the lowered leg.
3·

4· Stay in this position for 10 to 20 seconds with deep breathing. Stretch
the hamstrings and thighs and with an exhalation move the right leg
to the Slr�asana position.

6. Do not bend the knees while lowering or raising the legs or you will
lose balance.
Effects
This asana makes the neck, abdominal walls and thighs powerful. I t
tones and strengthens the intestines and the spine.
84. Urdhva Padmasana in. Sir�asana Six* (Plate 21 1)
.

Urdhva means above or high. Padmasana (Plate 1 04) is the lotus pose
described earlier. In this variation, Padmasana is done in the head stand.
Technique
1 . This pose is �o be done after the Eka Pada (Plates 208 and 209) and
Padvaika Pada S1rsasanas. (Plate 2 1 o.) After completing these two positions cross the legs as in Padmasana. First place the right foot over the
left thigh and the left foot over the right thigh.
•

2. Press the knees closer to each other and stretch the thighs up vertic­
ally. (Plate 2 1 1 )
3 · Hold this position for half a minute with deep and even breaths.
Then, exhale and extend the thighs as far back as possible. (Plate 2 1 2)
•

4· Uncross the legs and return to S1r�asana. Now cross the legs the other
way, first placing the left foot over the right thigh and then the right
foot over the left thigh. Stay like this also for half a minute and then
extend the thighs back.
5· While stretching the thighs up do not change the position of the head
or the neck.
Effects
This posture gives an extra pull to the dorsal region, the ribs and the
pelvic region. Consequently, the chest is fully expanded and blood
circulates properly in the pelvic region. To give an added stretch, one
can perform the pose by giving the trunk a lateral twist while doing
the head stand. This is called:

Si"r�asana for some time. Then cross the legs the other way and repeat
the pose.

4· Relax the crossed legs one by one, stretch them back to S!r�asana and
then lower them gradually and straight to the floor with an exhalation.
'

Effects

This pose has the same effects as the earlier one. Further the abdominal
organs are toned by contraction and an additional supply of blood.
87. Salamba Sarvangasana I Two* (Plates 223, 224 and 234)

Alamba means a prop, a support and sa together with or accompanied
by. Salamba, therefore, means supported or propped up. Sarvanga
(Sarva =all, whole, entire, complete; anga = limb or body) means the

9· If you cannot do the asana without support use a stool and follow
the technique. See Plate 225.
Technique for advanced pupils
I . Lie flat on the back on the carpet.
2. Keep the legs stretched out, tightened at the knees. Place the hands
by the side of the legs, palms down. (Plate 219)
3· Take a few deep breaths. Exhale slowly and at the same time raise
both legs together and bring them at a right angle to the body as in
Plates 226, 227 and 228. Remain in this position and inhale, keeping the
legs steady.
4· Exhale, again raise the legs further up by lifting the hips and back
from the floor, pressing the palms gently against the floor as in Plates
229, 230 and 23 1 .
5· When the whole trunk is raised off the ground, bend the elbows

and place the palms on the back of the ribs, resting the shoulders well
on thl! floor. (Plate 232)
6. Utilise the palm pressure and raise the trunk and legs up vertically
as in Plate 233 so that the breast-bone presses the chin to form a firm
chinlock. The contraction of the throat and pressing the chin against
the breast-bone to form a firm chinlock is known as Jalandhara Bandha.
Remember to bring the chest forward to touch the chin and not to bring
the chin towards the chest. If the latter is done, the spine is not
stretched completely and the full effect of this asana will not be felt.
7. Only the back of the head and neck, the shoulders and the upper
portion of the arms up to the elbows should rest well on the floor. The
remainder of the body should be in one straight line, perpendicular to
the floor. This is the final position. (Side view : Plate 234)
8. In the beginning, there is a tendency for the legs to swing out of
the perpendicular. To correct this, tighten the back thigh muscles and
stretch up vertically.
9· The elbows should not be placed wider than the shoulders. Try

212

Light on Yoga

233

and stretch the shoulders away from the neck and also to bring the
elbows close to each other. If the elbows are widened, the trunk cannot
be pulled up properly and the pose will look imperfect. Also see that the
neck is straight with the centre of the chin resting on the sternum.
In the beginning, the neck moves sideways and if this is not corrected,
it will cause pain and injure the neck.
10. Remain in this pose for not less than 5 minutes. Gradually
increase the time to 1 5 minutes; this will have no ill effects.
1 1 . Release the hands, slide down to the floor, lie flat and relax.
As the weight of the whole body is borne on the neck and shoulders
and as the hands are used to support the weight this asana is called
Salamba Sarvangasana. In Sarvangasana there are various movements
which can be done in addition to the basic pose described above.

Effects
The importance of Sarvangasana cannot be over-emphasised. It is one
of the greatest boons conferred on humanity by our ancient sages.
Sarvangasana is the Mother of asanas. As a mother strives for harmony
and happiness in the home, so this asana strives for the harmony and
happiness of the human system. It is a panacea for most common ail-

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

213

ments. There are several endocrin;: organs or ductless glands in the
human system which bathe in blood, absorb the nutriments from the
blood and secrete hormones for the proper functioning of a balanced
and well developed body and brain. If the glands fail to function
properly, the hormones are not produced as they should be and the
body starts to deteriorate. Amazingly enough many of the asanas
have a direct effect on the glands and help them to function properly.
Sarvangasana does this for the thyroid and parathyroid glands which
are situated in the neck region, since due to the firm chinlock their
blood supply is increased. Further, since the body is inverted the
venous blood flows to the heart without any strain by force of gravity.
Healthy blood is allowed to circulate around the neck and chest. As
a result, persons suffering from breathlessness, palpitation, asthma,
bronchitis and throat ailments get relief. As the head remains firm in this
inverted position, and the supply of the blood to it is regulated by the
firm chinlock, the nerves are soothed and headaches-even chronic
ones -disappear. Continued practice of this asana eradicates common
colds and other nasal disturbances. Due to the soothing effect of the pose
on the nerves, those suffering from hypertension, irritation, shortness of
temper, nervous breakdown and insomnia are relieved. The change in
bodily gravity also affects the abdominal organs so that the bowels
move freely and constipation vanishes. As a result the system is freed
from toxins and one feels full of energy. The asana is recommended
for urinary disorders and uterine displacement, menstrual trouble, piles
and hernia. It also helps to relieve epilepsy, low vitality and anaemia.
It is no over-statement to say that if a person regularly practises
Sarvangasana he will feel new vigour and strength, and will be happy
and confident. New life will flow into him, his mind will be at peace
and he will feel the joy of life. After a long illness, the practice of this
asana regularly twice a day brings back lost vitality. The Sarvangasana
cycle activates the abdominal organs and relieves people suffering from
stomach and intestinal ulcers, severe pains in the abdomen and colitis.
People suffering from high blood pressure should not attempt
Salamba Sarvangasana I unless they do Jialasana (Plate 244) first and
can stay in it for not less than 3 minutes.
Halasana is described on p. 2 1 6 (Plate 244).
The Sarvezngasana Cycle
These various movements can be practised at one stretch after stay­
ing in Sarvangasana I (Plate 223) from 5 to ro minutes or more accord­
ing to capacity; do them for 20 to 30 seconds at a time each side
except Halasana, which should last from 3 to 5 minutes at a stretch.

88. Salamba Sarvangasana II Three* (Plate 235)
This position is slightly harder than the first one.
Technique
I. Do Salamba Sarvangasana I. (Plate 223)

2. Release the hands from the back of the trunk, interlock the fingers,
turn the wrists and extend the arms. The thumbs will then touch the
floor and the palms will face outwards. (Plate 235.) The head will be
on one side of the verticaUy extended body and the arms will be on the
other side.

235
3· Keep the legs and back as steady as possible.
4· This pose can be done for a minute after doing Sarvangasana I .
Effects
As the balance is maintained by stretching the back muscles and as
the weight of the body falls on the back of the neck, the back and
the neck gain strength. The arm muscles are also toned.
89. Niralamba Sarvangasana I Three* (Plate 236)
Alamba means a prop, a support, while nir conveys the sense of away

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

215

from, without, free from. Niralamba, therefore, means without support.
This variation of Sarvangasana is harder than the earlier two, as in it the
body is not supported by the arms and the body weight and balance
are maintained by the muscles of the neck, back and abdomen, which
are thus strengthened.
Technique
1 . Do Salamba Sarvangasana I. (Plate 223)
2. Release the hands, bring them over the head, rest the extended
arms on the floor on the same side of the vertical body as the head,
and balance. (Plate 236)

3· This pose can also b e held for a minute.
90. Niralamba Sarvangasana II Four* (Plate 237)

This is the hardest of the Sarvangasana poses. It enables one to
extend the spinal vertebrae more than in the other Sarvangasanas
and thus helps one to achieve a perfect Salamba Sarvangasana. (Plate
223)

216

Technique
r . From the previous pose, raise the hands and place the palms on
or by the side of the knees. (Plate 237.) Do not rest the legs on the
palms.

237
2. Stay in the pose for a minute. Then move into Salamba Sarvangasana
I for some time, slide into Halasana (Plate 244) and continue the other
Sarvangasana movements one after the other.
Effects
By practising these various Sarvangasana movements, the entire body
is toned by an increase in the flow of blood and by the elimination
of toxin-forming waste matter. These asanas stimulate one like tonics.
After convalescing one can practise them for speedier recovery from
weakness.
9 1 . Halasana Four* (Plate 244)
Hala means a plough, the shape of which this posture resembles, hence
the name. It is a part of Sarvangasana I and a continuation thereof.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

217

Technique
1. Do Salamba Sarvangasana I (Plate 223) with a firm chinlock.
2. Release the chinlock, lower the trunk slightly, moving the arms
and legs over the head and resting the toes on the floor. (Plate 238)

23 8
3· Tighten the knees by pulling up the hamstring muscles at the back
of the thighs and raise the trunk. (Plate 239)

239
4· Place the hands in the middle of the back and press it to keep the
trunk perpendicular to thel floor. (Plate 240)
5· Stretch the arms on the floor in the direction opposite to that of
the legs. (Plate 241)
6. Hook the thumbs and stretch the arms and legs. (Plate 242)
7· Interlock the fingers (Plate 243) and turn the wrists so that the
thumbs rest on the floor. (Plate 244.) Stretch the palms along with the

218

Light on Yoga

241

242
fingers, tighten the arms at the elbows and pull them from the
shoulders.
8. The legs and the hands are stretched in opposite directions and this
stretches the spine completely.
9· While interlocking the fingers, it is advisable to change the interlock.
Suppose that the right thumb touches the floor first, maintain the
position for a minute. Then release the grip and bring the left thumb

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

219

first on the floor, follow the interlock, finger by finger, and stretch out
the arms for the same length of time. This will lead to harmonious
development and elasticity of both the shoulders, elbows and wrists.

243

244
IO. In the beginning interlocking will be difficult. By gradual practice
of the above mentioned positions, you will interlock the fingers easily.
I I. In the beginning it is also difficult to keep the toes firmly on the
floor behind the head. If you lengthen the timing and stretch of
Sarvangasana I (Plate 223) before going into Halasana, the toes will
remain longer on the floor.
I2. Remain in the attainable pose from one to five minutes with normal
breathing.
1 3· Release the hands. Raise the legs up to Sarvangasana I and
gradually slide down to the floor. Lie flat on the back and relax.
Effects
The effect of Halas ana is the same as that of Sarvangasana I . (Plate
223.) In addition, the abdominal organs are rejuvenated due to con­
traction. The spine receives an extra supply of blood due to the
forward bend and this helps to relieve backache. Cramps in the hands

220

Light on Yoga

are cured by interlocking and stretching the palms and fingers. People
suffering from stiff shoulders and elbows, lumbago and arthritis of the
back find relief in this asana. Griping pain in the stomach due to wind
is also relieved and lightness is felt immediately.
The pose is good for people with a tendency for high blood pressure.
If they perform Halasana first and then Sarvangasana I, they will not
feel the rush of blood or the sensation of fullness in the head.
Halasana is a preparatory pose to Paschimottanasana. (Plate 160.)
If one improves in Halasana, the resulting mobility of the back will
enable one to perform Paschimottanasana well.
Note. For persons suffering from hi gh blood pressure the following

technique is recommended for doing Halasana before they attempt
Salamba Sarvangasana I.
1 . Lie flat on the back on the floor.
2. Exhale, slowly raise the legs to a perpendicular position and stay
there breathing normally for about 10 seconds.
Exhale, bring the legs over and beyond the head and touch the
toes on the floor. Keep the toes on the floor and the legs stiff at the
knees.
3·

4· If you have difficulty in keeping the toes on the floor, then place a
chair or a stool behind the head and rest the toes on it.
If the breathing becomes heavy or fast do not rest the toes on the
floor, but on a stool or chair. Then fullness or pressure is not felt in
the head.
5.

6. Extend the arms over the head, keep them on the floor and stay in
this position with normal breathing for 3 minutes.
7·

Throughout the asana, gaze at the tip of the nose with the eyes shut.

92. Kany.apzdasana One* (Plate 246)
Kar�a means the ear. Plda means pain, discomfort or pressure. This
is a variant of Halasana and can be done along with it.
Technique
1 . Do Halasana (Plate 244) and after completing the time limit for that
pose, flex the knees and rest the right knee by the side of the right
ear and the left knee by the side of the left.
2. Both knees should rest on the floor, pressing the ears.
3· Keep the toes stretched out and join the heels and toes. Rest the

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

221

hands either on the back of the ribs (Plate 245) or interlock the
fingers and stretch out the arms (Plate 246) as in Halasana.

245

4· Remain in this position for half a minute or a minute with normal
breathing.
Effects
This asana rests the trunk, heart and Jegs. The spine is stretched more
while bending the knees, and this helps the circulation of blood round
the waistline.
93· Supta Kor:asana Two* (Plate 247)
Supta means lying down and ko�a an angle. It is a variation of Halasana
in which the legs are spread apart.

222

Technique
1 . From Kar�ap1dasana (Plate 246), stretch the legs straight and
spread the legs as far apart as you can.
2. Pull the trunk up and tighten the knees.
3· Hold the right toe with the right hand and the left toe with the
left one. Keep the heels up. After gripping the toes, move the dorsal
region of the spine still further up and extend the hamstring muscles.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

223

Technique
1 . Do Supta Ko�asana (Plate 247) and come back to Halasana.
2. Place the palms on the back of the ribs. (Plate 240)
3· Move both the legs as far as you can to the left.
4· Tighten both knees, raise the trunk up with the help of the palms
and stretch the legs. (Plate 249)

249
5· Remain in this position for half a minute with normal breathing.
6. Exhale, move the legs to the right until they are in line with the
head and hold the pose for half a minute. Do not disturb the position
of the chest and trunk when the legs are moved. The chest and trunk
should remain as in Sarvangasana or Halasana.
Effects
In this asana, the spine moves laterally and becomes more elastic. The
colon, which is inverted during the movements, is exercised properly
and elimination will be complete. People suffering from acute or chronic
constipation which is the mother of several diseases derive great benefit
from this asana. If rubbish is dumped outside our house we feel sick.
How much more so when waste matter which creates toxins is allowed
to accumulate in our own sys tern? If this waste matter is not eliminated,
diseases will enter the body like thieves and rob us of health. If the
bowels do not move freely, the mind becomes dull and one feels heavy
and irritable. This asana helps us to keep the bowels free and thereby
win the prize of health.
95· Eka Pada Sarvcmgiisana Five* (Plate 250)
Eka means one, single. Pada means the foot. In this variation of

224

Sarvangasana, one leg is on the floor in Halasana, while the other is
in a vertical position along with the trunk.
Technique
r . Do Salamba Sarvangasana I. (Plate 223)

2. Keep the left leg up in Sarvangasana. Exhale and move the right
leg down to the floor to Halasana. (Plate 2 50.) It should remain stiff
and straight and not bend at the knee.

250
3· While resting the right leg on the floor, the left knee should be kept
taut and not allowed to tilt sideways. The left leg should be kept
straight, facing the head.
4· Stay in the pose for 20 seconds maintaining normal breathing.
5· Exhale, lift the right leg back to Sarvangasana, and then move the
left leg down to the floor in Halasana, keeping the right leg vertically
up and stiff. Lifting the leg from the floor back to Sarvangasana
exercises the abdominal organs more than if one brings both legs down
to Halasana.
6. Stay on this side for the same length of time.

3· Exhale, swing the legs back to Sarvangasana (Plate 22 3), slide them
gradually to the floor by removing the hands from the back and rest
on the floor.
Effects of Setu Bandha Sarvangasana and Eka Pada Setu Bandha
Sarvangasana
These two asanas give the spine a backward movement and remove
the strain on the neck caused by the other various movements of
Sarvangasana.
A healthy and flexible spine indicates a healthy nervous system. If
the nerves are healthy a man is sound in mind and body.
100. Urdhva Padmasana in Sarvangasana Four* (Plate 261)
Ordhva means above, high. Padma means a lotus. In this Sarvangasana
variation, the legs, instead of being kept straight up, are bent at the
knees and crossed so that the right foot rests on the left thigh and the
left foot on the right thigh as in the lotus pose. (Plate 1 04)
Technique
r . From Salamba Sarvangasana, bend the legs at the knees and cross

them. First place the right foot over the left thigh, and then the left

foot over the left thigh. Stay for an equal length of time in all these
positions as in the earlier ones.
103. Pincjasana in Sarvcmgiisana Five* (Plate 269)
Pin�a means embryo or foetus. In this variation of Sarvangasana
which is a continuation of the earlier posture, the bent crossed legs are
brought down until they rest on the head. The posture resembles
that of an embryo in the womb, hence the name.
Techniq ue
I . From Urdhva Padmasana in Sarvangasana (Plate 261), exhale, bend
and lower the crossed legs from the hips towards the head.

268
2. Rest the legs over the head. (Plate 268)
3· Release the hands from the back, and clasp the legs. (Plate 269.)
While clasping, move the trunk nearer to the neck to rest the legs well.
4· Remain in this position from 20 to 30 seconds with normal breath­
ing and go back to Urdhva Padmasana in Sarvangasana.
104. Piirsva Pincjiisana in Sarviingiisana Eight* (Plates 270 and 271)
Parsva means the side or flank. In this Pindasana variation of the earlier
pose, both the bent knees are moved sideways and placed on the floor
on the same side of the trunk. This is the lateral embryo pose in
Sarvangasana.
Technique
r . After releasing the handclasp from Pin�asana (Plate 269) bring the
hands back and place the palms at the back of the ribs. (Plate 268)

Yogiisanas, Bandha and Kriyii

2. Turn the hips sideways to the right, exhale and lower both knees
to the floor. The left knee should be by the side of the right ear.
(Plate 270)

270
3· The left shoulder will be raised off the floor in the beginning. Push
the shoulder against the floor and press the left hand firmly against
the back. If this is not done, you will lose balance and roll over to
one side.
4· Due to the lateral twist, breathing will be fast and difficult as the
diaphragm is pressed in this position.

236

Light on Yoga

The knee near the ear will not rest on the floor to start with, but
only after long practice.
5.

6. Stay in this position for 20 to 30 seconds, with normal breathing.
7· Exhale, come up from the right side and move the crossed legs over
to the left, so that the left foot will be near the left ear. (Plate 271.)
Stay here also for the same length of time.

271
8. Go back to Urdhva Padmasana. (Plate 261.) Release the lotus pose
by uncrossing the legs and return to Salamba Sarvangasana.
9· Now change the position of the crossed legs. Cross the legs again
by putting the left foot over the right thigh first and then the right foot
over the left thigh instead of the other way as done earlier.
1 o. Repeat the movements again on both the sides as described
earlier.
Effects of Urdhva Padmasana and Parsva Pincf.asana movements in
Sarvangasana
The change of crossing the legs brings equal pressure on both sides of
the abdomen and colon and relieves constipation. For those suffering
from chronic constipation a longer stay in Parsva Pin�asana is recom­
mended, and one minute on each side will prove most efficacious.
Griping pain in the stomach is relieved by these poses.
Persons with extremely flexible knees, can easily perform these
positions. It is, however, difficult for many people to cr.oss the legs in
Padmasana. For them a longer stay in Parsva Halasana (Plate 249)-

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

237

(there also the spine and trunk get a lateral twist but the legs remain
straight)- is recommended.
In all these positions breathing at first will be fast and laboured.
Try to maintain normal breathing.
Note. The spine is given the forward, lateral and backward move­
ments in these variations of Sarvangasana. In Halasana, Eka Pada
Sarvangasana, Karr;ta Pidasana and Pinc;Iasana the spine moves in the
forward direction. In Parsvaika Pada Sarvanga, Parsva Halasana and
Parsva Pindasana the spine moves laterally, as in Parsva Sarvangasana
and in Pariva Ordhva Padmasana. In Setu Bandha and Uttana Padma
Mayiira it is given a backward movement. These movements tone the
spine on all sides and keep it healthy.
It is related that in the Krita Age (the first Age of the Universe)
a host of Danavas (giants and demons) became invincible in battle
under the leadership of Vrtra and scattered the Devas (or Gods) in all
directions. Realising that they could not regain their power until Vrn·a
was destroyed, the gods appeared before their Grandsire, Brahma, the
creator. Brahma instructed them to consult Visnu who asked them to
obtain the bones of a sage called Dadhicha, from which to make a
demon-slaying weapon. The gods appeared before the sage and begged
the boon according to Visnu's
advice. The sage renounced his body for
.
the benefit of the gods. From the spine of Dadhicha was fashioned
Vajra, the thunderbolt, which Indra the king of the gods hurled and
slew Vrtra
. .
The story is symbolical. The Danavas represent the tamasic qualities
in men and diseases. The Devas represent health, harmony and peace.
To destroy the tamasic qualities and the diseases due to them and to
enjoy heal�h and happiness, we have to make our spines strong as a
thunderbolt like the spine of Dadhlcha. Then we shall enjoy health,
harmony and happiness in abundance.

until the toes of the left foot almost touch the finger-tips of the out­
stretched left hand. (Plate 274·) Try and keep the back well on the
floor. In the initial stages, the right shoulder will be lifted off the floor.
To prevent this ask a friend to press it down, or catch hold of a heavy
piece of furniture with the right hand when the legs are turned side­
ways to the left.
5· Both legs should go down together, the knees being kept tight
throughout. As far as possible keep the lumbar portion of the back
on the floor and turn the legs only from the hips. When the legs are
near the outstretched left hand, move the abdomen to the right.

5· Inhale, move the head and trunk back to the floor and the left leg
back to the perpendicular. (Plate 284.) This completes the first
movement..
6. Exhale, hold the left big toe, bend the left knee and move the
grasped toe towards the right shoulder. Bend the left elbow, stretch
the left arm behind the head and move the head up into the space
between the left forearm and the left shin. (Plate 286.) Take a few
deep breaths.

7· Inhale, move the head back to the floor, bring the left arm in front
of the head and straighten the left arm and leg. Take the left leg
back to the perpendicular, maintaining the toe hold throughout.
(Plate 284.) During this movement also the right leg remains fully
extended on the floor throughout and the right hand rests on the right
thigh. This completes the second movement.
8. Exhale, and without disturbing the head and trunk or lifting the
right leg off the floor, move the left arm and leg sideways to the left
down to the floor. (Plate 287.) Do not release the toe hold but bring
the left arm in level with the shoulders on the floor. Stay in this position

246

for about 20 seconds without bending the left leg at the knee. Breathe
normally.

287
9· Now inhale and without bending the left leg at the knee, bring
it back to the perpendicular without releasing the grip on the left big
toe or disturbing the right leg stretched on the floor. (Plate 284)
Exhale, release the toe grip, rest the left leg on the floor beside
the right one and keep the left hand on the left thigh. This completes
the third movement. To start with it is difficult to keep the extended
leg stretched right out on the floor throughout these three movements.
Therefore, ask a friend to keep the leg down by pressing the thigh
just above the knee, or press the foot against a wall.
IO.

After completing the three movements on the left side, take a few
deep inhalations and then repeat them on the right, substituting the
word 'left' for the word 'right'.

Effects
The legs will develop properly by the practice of this asana. Persons
suffering from sciatica and paralysis of the legs will derive great benefit
from it. The blood is made to circulate in the legs and hips where
the nerves are rejuvenated. The pose removes stiffness in the hip
joints and prevents hernia. I t can be practised by both men and
women.

8. Exhale, unfold the arms and place the hands on the floor, bend the
knees, lower the legs and trunk to the floor, release the head grip,
straighten the neck, lie flat on the back and relax.
Effects
The asana strengthens the neck and tones the cervical, dorsal, lumbar
and sacral regions of the spine. The extensor muscles of the back grow
powerful and the hips .are contracted and hardened. The pineal, pitui­
tary, thyroid and adrenal glands are bathed in blood and function
properly.

Effects
This simple asana works on the dorsal and lumbar regions of the spine.
People with very stiff backs find the other lateral twisting positions
extremely difficult. This pose helps to make the back supple. People
with arthritis will find it very beneficial.

Technique
I . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the left leg at the knee, hold the left foot with the hands and
place it at the root of the right thigh near the pelvis so that the left heel
is kept near the navel. The left leg will then be in the half lotus pose.

3· Bend the right foot at the knee and bring the right foot back and rest
the right heel beside the right hip. The inner side of the right calf will
touch the outer side of the right thigh. Keep both the knees on the floor
near each other.
4· Exhale, turn the left arm from the shoulder behind the back, bend the

knee, the palm touching the floor and the fingers pointing to the right.
(Plates 299 and 300)
6. Hold the left foot tight and turn the trunk to as far to the left as you
can. Turn the neck in either direction and gaze over the shoulder.
7· Stay in the pose from half a minute to a minute with normal or deep

breathing.
8. Then release the pose and repeat it on the other side for the same
length of time. Here the right foot will be placed at the root of the left
thigh and will be held from behind the back by the right hand. The
left leg will be bent at the knee and the left heel will rest on the floor
beside the left hip. The left hand will be placed underneath the right
knee and the trunk will be twisted as far to the right as possible.
9· After completing the asana on both the sides, stretch out the legs,
straighten the arms and rest.
Effects
The knees and shoulders become flexible by the practice of this pose. It

is not very effective for people with elastic spinal movements, but the
arthritic will find the pose to be a blessing.
r 14. Marzchyasana Ill Ten* (Plates 303 and 304)
This is one of the sitting lateral twisting postures.
Technique
r . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)

2. Bend the left knee, place the sole and heel of the left foot flat on the
floor. The shin of the left leg should be perpendicular to the floor and
the calf should touch the thigh. Place the left heel near the perineum.
The inner side of the left foot should touch the inner side of the out­
stretched right thigh.
3· With an exhalation, turn the spine about 90 degrees to the left, so
that the chest goes beyond the bent left thigh and bring the right arm
over the left thigh. (Plate 301)
4· Place the right shoulder beyond the left knee and stretch the right arm
out forwards by turning the spine still more to the left and stretching the
region at the back of the right floating ribs. (Plate 302.) Take two breaths.

5· With an exhalation, twist the right arm round the left knee, flex the

right elbow and place the right wrist at the back of the waist. Inhale and
hold the pose.
6. Exhale deeply and turn the left arm from the shoulder behind the
back. Either clasp the left hand behind the back with the right hand or
vice versa. (Plates 303 and 304.) In the beginning, one finds it difficult
to twist the trunk sideways, but with practice, the armpit touches the
bent knee. Mter one has twisted the arm round the knee, one also
finds it difficult to clasp the fingers ofone hand with the other. Gradually
one learns to clasp the fingers, then the palm and lastly to hold the hand
at ·the wrist behind the back.
7· The right arm should lock the left bent knee tightly. There should
be no space between the right armpit and the bent left knee.

256

8. After clasping the hands at the back, turn the spine still more to the
left by tugging at the clasped hands.
9· The whole of the outstretched right leg should remain straight and

securely on the floor, but you will not be able to achieve this to start
with. Tighten the muscles of the outstretched thigh so that the knee-cap
is pulled up towards the thigh and also tighten the muscles of the calf
of the outstretched leg. Then the leg will remain firm and extended on
the floor.
10. Stay in this position from half a minute to a minute with normal
breathing. The neck may be turned either way to gaze at the toes of the
extended leg on the floor or to look over the shoulder.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

257

I 1. Unclasp the hands at the back and turn the trunk back to its original
position. Lower the bent leg and extend it fully on the floor.

12. Then repeat the pose on the other side. This time bend the right
knee and place the right foot firmly on the floor so that the right heel
touches the perineum and the inner side of the right foot touches the
outstretched left thigh. Turn the trunk about 90 degrees to the right so
that the left armpit touches the bent right knee. With an exhalation,
twist the left arm round the right knee and bring the left hand to the
back of the waist. Then throw the right arm behind the back from the
shoulder and flexing the right elbow, bring the right hand to the left hand
and clasp them. Turn still more to the right and gaze at either the toes
of the outstretched left leg or over the right shoulder. Stay on this side
also for the same length of time. Unclasp the hands, turn the trunk back
to normal, stretch the right leg on the floor and relax.
Effects
By the regular practice of this asana, splitting backaches, lumbago and
pains in the hips disappear rapidly. The liver and the spleen are con­
tracted and so are toned and cease to be sluggish. The muscles of the
neck gain power. Sprains in the shoulder and displacement of the
shoulder joints are relieved and the shoulder movements become free.
The intestines also benefit from this asana. Its effects will be less on
lean persons, for whom there are better poses described later. It also
helps to reduce the size of the abdomen.

5· Place the right shoulder beyond the left knee and stretch the right
arm forward by turning the spine still more to the left by stretching the
region at the back of the floating ribs. Take a breath.
6. Exhale, move the right arm round the left knee, bend the right elbow
and place the right hand at the back of the waist. The left knee is locked
tightly in the right armpit. Take a breath.
7· Now with a deep exhalation, twist the left arm from the shoulder
behind the back and clasp the right hand behind the back with the left
hand. Stretch the chest and pull up the spine. (Plates 305 and 306)

8. Remain in this position for 30 seconds. Breathing will be faster.
9. Release the hands and straighten the legs.
10. Then repeat the pose on the other side reading 'right' for 'left' and
vice versa. Stay on both sides for the same length of time. Release the
hands, straighten the legs and relax.
Effects
The pressure of the heel against the navel and the clasping of the hands
behind the back rejuvenates the nerves round the navel. It tones the

liver, spleen and pancreas. Calcium deposits in the shoulder joints are
resolved and the pose helps free movement at the shoulders.
I I6. A rdha Matsyendrasana I Eight* (Plates 3 I I and 3I2)
Ardha means half. In the Hafha Yoga Pradipika, Matsyendra is men­
tioned, as one of the founders of Ha�ha Vidya. It is related that once
Lord Siva went to a lonely island an.d explained to his consort Parvati
the mysteries of Yoga. A fish near the shore heard everything with
concentration and remained motionless while listening. S iva, realising
that the fish had learnt Yoga, sprinkled water upon it, and immediately
the fish gained divine form and became Matsyendra (Lord of the Fishes)
and thereafter spread the knowledge ofYoga. Paripiirna Matsyendrasana
(Plates 336 and 339), where the spine is given the maximum lateral twist,
is dedicated to Matsyendra. Ardha Matsyendrasana is a milder version
of that asana.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor, with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the left knee and join the thigh and calf; raise the seat from the
floor, place the left foot under the buttocks and sit on the left foot so that
the left heel rests under the left buttock. The foot used as the seat should
be kept horizontal on the floor, the outer side of the ankle and the little
. toe of the foot resting on the ground. If the foot is not so placed, it will
be impossible to sit on it. Balance securely in this position.
3· Then bend the right knee and lifting the right leg from the floor,
place it by the outer side of the left thigh so that the outer side of the
right ankle touches the outer side of the left thigh on the floor. Balance in
this position, keeping the right shin perpendicular to the floor. (Plate
307)
4· Turn the trunk 90 degrees to the right until the left armpit touches
the outer side of the right thigh. Bring the armpit over the right knee.
(Plate 308.) Exhale, stretch the left arm from the shoulder and twist it
round the right knee. Bend the left elbow and move the left wrist to the
back of the waist.
5· The left arm should lock the bent right knee tightly and there should
be no space between the left armpit and the bent right knee. To achieve
this, exhale and move the trunk forward. Stay in this position and take
2 breaths.
6. Now exhale deeply and swing back the right arm from the shoulder,
bend the right elbow, move the right hand behind the waist and either
clasp it with the left hand or vice versa. At first you will be able to catch

308

310

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

261

a finger or two. With practice it will be possible to catch the palms and
then the wrists behind the back. (Plate 309)
7. The neck may be turned to the left and the gaze directed over the left
shoulder (Plate 3 1 0), or to the right, and the gaze fixed at the centre of
the eyebrows. (Plates 3 1 1 and 312.) The spinal twist will be greater if
the neck is turned to the left than when to the right.

311

312

8. As the diaphragm is squeezed by the spinal twist, the breathing will
at first become short and fast. Do not be nervous. After some practice
the pose can be held from half a minute to a minute with normal
breathing.
9· Release the hands, remove the right foot from the floor and straighten
the right and then the left leg.
10. Repeat the pose on the other side and hold it for the same length
of time. Here, bend the right leg and sit on the right foot so that the
right heel is under the right buttock. Place the left leg over the right leg
and rest the left foot on the floor so that the outer side of the left ankle
touches the outer side of the right thigh on the floor. Turn the trunk
90 degrees to the left, placing the right armpit over the left knee and
twist the right arm round the left knee. Flex the right elbow and move
the right hand behind the waist. Hold the pose and take 2 breaths. Again

262

exhale completely and swing the left arm back from the shoulder, bend
the left elbow and clasp the hands behind the back at the wrist. Then
release and relax.

I I . In the beginning it may not be possible to twist either arm round
the opposite knee. In that case try and hold the opposite foot, keeping
the arm straight at the elbow. (Plates 3 I3 and 3I4.) I t also takes time
to clasp the hands behind the back. Gradually, the backward stretch of
the arms will increase, and one will be able to catch at first the fingers,
next the palms, then the wrist and as the pose is mastered even the fore­
arms above the wrists. Beginners who find it difficult to sit on the foot
can sit on the floor. (Plates 3 I 5 and 3I6)
Effects
By the practice of this asana, one derives the benefits mentioned under
Mar1chyasana III. (Posture r 14 and Plate 303.) But here as the range
of movement is more intensified, the effects will also be greater. In
Marlchyasana III the upper part of the abdomen is squeezed. Here the
lower part of the abdomen has the benefit of the exercise. The prostate
and bladder are not enlarged if one practises regularly.

In these two poses the arms hang from the neck like a garland, hence
the name.
1 1 9. Piisiisana Fifteen* (Plates 328 and 329)
Pasa means a noose or cord. In this posture, squat on the floor, turn the
trunk about 90 degrees to one side, twist one arm round both the thighs
and turning the other arm from the shoulder clasp hands behind the
back. The arms are used as a noose to hold the trunk to the legs, hence
the name.
Technique
1 . Squat on the floor with the soles and heels completely on the floor.
2. Keep the knees and feet together, raise the seat from the floor and
balance. (Plate 317)
3· After securing the balance, twist the trunk about 90 degrees to the
right until the left armpit is beyond the outer side of the right thigh
near the right knee. (Plate 323.) To achieve the maximum twist, flex the
left knee about an inch forward.

323

324

4· Exhale, extend the left arm from the shoulder (Plate 324), leave no
space between the left armpit and the right thigh, turn the left arm round
the right thigh and, bending the left elbow towards the left leg, bring
the left hand near the left hip. Take a breath.

5. Exhale, twist the right arm from the shoulder behind the back, bend
the right elbow and hook the fingers behind the back near the left hip.
(Plate 325)

6. Gradually clasp the palms (Plate 326) and when this becomes easy,
clasp the wrists. (Plates 327, 328 and 329)
7. Tighten the calf muscles to maintain the balance, twist the spine as
far to the right as you can and stay in the pose from 30 to 6o seconds
with normal breathing. Turn the neck and gaze over either shoulder.
8. Release the hand clasp and repeat the pose on the other side. Here,
twist the trunk to the left, bring the right arm round the left thigh,
bend the right elbow and bring the right hand near the right hip. Then
with an exhalation turn the left arm back from the shoulder, bend the
left elbow and clasp the right hand with the left behind the back near
the right hip.
Effects
The pose gives strength and elasticity to the ankles. Persons whose work
entails standing for hours will rest their feet in this position. It tones the
spine and makes one agile. The shoulders move freely and grow

32 7

stronger. The pose reduces fat around the abdomen, massages the
abdominal organs and at the same time expands the chest fully. It is
more intense than Ardha Matsyendrasana I and I I (Plates 3I I and 330)
and so it gives greater benefits. It is good for curing sluggishness of the
liver, spleen and pancreas and is recommended for persons suffering
from diabetes. I t also improves digestion.
I20. A rdha Matsyendrasana II Nineteen* (Plates 330 and 3 3 I )
This asana is a variation of Ardha Matsyendrasana I (Plate 3I I ) and it
gives a greater lateral twist to the spine.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the right knee and place the right foot at the root of the left
thigh, pressing the heel against the navel.
3· Exhale, turn the trunk 90 degrees to the left, swing the left arm from
the shoulder behind the back, bend the left elbow and with the left hand
grasp the right ankle or shin.
The left leg should remain stretched straight on the floor through­
out, and the sole of the left foot or the left big toe should be held by the
right hand and the right arm should be kept straight. To start with one
finds it difficult to keep the left leg stretched throughout on the floor. In
that case bend the left knee, catch the left big toe with the right hand
and then straighten out both the right arm and the left leg. Turn the
neck to the right and gaze over the right shoulder. (Plates 330 and 33 I )

6. Release the grip on the legs, straighten them and then repeat the pose
on the other side, changing the word left to that for right and vice versa.

7· Stay on both sides for the same length oftime and then relax.
Effects
The abdominal organs are toned by being contracted on one side and
stretched on the other. Due to the lateral twist of the spine, backaches,
lumbago and pain in the hip joints disappear rapidly. The neck muscles
become more powerful and the shoulder movements become easier. The
prostate and bladder do not become hypertrophied if one practises this
asana regularly. It helps one to achieve Paripiin}a Mats yendrasana (Plates
336 and 339), where the spine is given the maximum lateral twist.

Effects
This exercises and massages the abdominal organs and keeps them
healthy. It tones the spine and keeps it elastic. It is a preparatory pose
for Paripurna Matsyendrasana. (Plates 336 and 339)
122. Paripurr:a Matsyendrasana Thirty-eight* (Plates 336 and 339)

Paripur�a means entire or complete. Matsyendra was one of the
founders of Ha!ha Vidya.
Verse 27 of the Hafha Yoga Pradi"pikii states 'Matsyendrasana in­
creases the appetite by fanning the gastric fire and destroys terrible
diseases in the body; when practised it rouses Ku�<;ialinl and makes the
moon steady.'
It is said that the breath in the right nostril is hot and that in the left
one is cold. Therefore, the breath in the right nostril is called the sun
breath and the right na<;ii is referred to as piilgala (of the colour of fire)
and the breath of the left nostril is called the moon breath and the left
na<;ii is called i<;ia. The moon travelling in i<;ia sprinkles its nectar through
the entire system and the sun travelling through piilgala dries out the
whole system, for the human body is regarded as a miniature universe.
It is said that the moon is located at the root of the palate, ever dropping
cool ambrosial nectar that is wasted by feeding the gastric fire. Matsyen­
drasana prevents this.
This asana is dedicated to the founder of Ha!ha Vidya Matsyendra.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Flex the right knee and place the right foot at the root of the left thigh,

the right heel pressing against the navel. Bend the left knee up and
bring it near the chest.

3· Exhale, twist the trunk to the left, and swinging the left arm from

the shoulder catch the right ankle with the left hand from behind the
back. (Plate 334.) Grip the ankle firmly. This is the first stage.
Lift the left foot over the right thigh and place it on the floor by the
outer side of the right knee. (Plate 335.) Take a few breaths. This is the
second stage.

stage of the asana. Stay in this pose from 30 to 6o seconds according to
your capacity. Breathing will be faster due to the pressure on the
diaphragm.

neck to the right, raise the chin and gaze up. (Plate 339.) This is the final
stage. Hold the pose on this side for the same length of time as on the
other.
5. Release the hold on the right foot, lift it over the left thigh and

straighten the right leg. Next release the grip over the left ankle,
straighten the left leg and relax.
Effects
This difficult lateral movement tones the spine by supplying the spinal
nerves with a copious supply of blood. It increases gastric activity,
helps to digest food and eliminate toxins. The spine and the abdomen
being kept healthy ensures tranquillity of body and mind. The spine
is given the maximum lateral twist.
123. Astavakrasana Thirteen* (Plates 342 and 343)
This asana is dedicated to the sage A�!avakra, the spiritual preceptor
of King Janaka of Mithila, who was the father of Sfta. It is related
that when the sage was in his mother's womb, his father Kagola (or
Kahola) made several mistakes while reciting the Vedas (the sacred
scriptures). Hearing these the unborn sage laughed. The father became
enraged and cursed his son to be born as Astavakra. So it came to
pass that he was born crooked in eight places. These crooks earned
him the name A�!avakra or Eight-Crooks. The sage's father had been
defeated in a philosophical debate by V��i, the court scholar of
Mithila. While yet a boy the sage became a great scholar and avenged
his father's defeat by worsting Vandi
. . in argument and becoming the
preceptor of Janaka. Then his father blessed him, his deformity
vanished and he became straight.
The asana is given in two stages.
Technique
I . Stand with the feet about 1 8 inches apart.

1 26. Bhujapzdasana Eight* (Plate 348)
Bhuja means an arm or shoulder. P1da means pain or pressure. In
this asana, the body is balanced on the hands by resting the back of
the knees on the shoulders, hence the name.
Technique
1 . Stand in Ta�asana. (Plate 1.) Spread the legs till the feet are about
two feet apart.
2. Stoop forward and bend the knees.
3· Place the palms on the floor about a foot and a half apart, between

7· Remain in the balancing position with normal breathing as long
as the wrists can bear the weight of the body. Then release the feet
by taking the legs back one by one (Plates 349 and 350) and then rest
them on the floor. Lift the hands from the floor and stand up in
Ta��Uisana. (Plate r )

8. Repeat the pose by changing the position of the interlocked ankles.
If, at first, the right foot is placed over the left one at the ankle, then

282

Light on Yoga

while repeating the pose place the left foot over the right one at the
ankle.
Effects
By the practice of this asana the hands and the wrists grow strong, as
do the abdominal muscles due to contraction of the abdomen. The
body will feel light. The minor muscles of the arms will be developed
and toned by the practice of this pose, which requires no special
apparatus or gymnasiums. The various parts of the body supply the
weights and counterweights. All that is needed is strength of will.
127. Mayuriisana Nine* (Plate 354)
Mayura means a peacock.
Technique
1 . Kneel on the floor with the knees slightly apart.
2. Bend forward, invert the palms and place them on the floor. The
little fingers should touch and the fingers should point towards the
feet. (Plate 351)

legs from the floor (either one by one or together) and at the same
time stretch the trunk and head forward. Keep the whole body parallel
to the floor with the legs stretched out straight and the feet together.
(Plate 354)
6. Hold the pose as long as you can, gradually increasing the time
to between 30 and 6o seconds. Do not put pressure on the ribs. The
diaphragm being pressed, breathing will be laboured.

Lower the head to the floor and then the legs. Place the knees on the
floor by the side of the hands, then lift the hands and relax.
7·

8. After mastering this position learn to cross the legs as in
Padmasana (Plate 1 04) while practising the posture instead of keeping
the legs stretched out straight. This variation is known as:
128. Padma Mayuriisana Ten* (Plate 355)

355

Effects
This asana tones up the abdominal portion of the body wonder­
fully. Due to the pressure of the elbows against the abdominal aorta,
blood circulates properly in the abdominal organs. This improves
digestive power, cures ailments of the stomach and spleen, and pre­
vents the accumulation of toxins due to faulty eating habits. Persons
suffering from diabetes will find the pose beneficial. As a peacock
destroys snakes, this asana kills toxins in the body. It also strengthens
the forearms, wrists and elbows.
129. Harrzsiisana Ten* (Plate 356)
Ha1psa means a swan. This posture is very similar to Maylirasana
(Plate 354), except that the placing of the hands is different. In
Mayiirasana the little fingers touch and the fingers point to the feet,
whereas in Ha1psasana the hands are so placed that the thumbs touch
and the fingers point to the head. The posture resembles the plant
balance in modern gymnastics.
Technique
1 . Kneel on the floor with the knees slightly apart.
2. Bend forward and place the palms on the floor. The thumbs should
touch and the fingers should point forward.

3· Bend the elbows and keep the forearms together. Rest the dia­
phragm on the elbows and the chest on the back of the upper arms.
4·

Stretch the legs straight one by one and keep them together.

5· Exhale, swing the trunk forward, bear the body weight on the
wrists and hands, raise the legs from the floor and keep them stretched
straight with the feet together and parallel to the floor. (Plate 356)

356
6. Balance in this position without holding your breath as long as you
can. The forearms will not remain perpendicular to the floor due to the
greater pressure on the wrists as a result of the position of the hands.
It is harder to balance in Hrup.sasana than in Mayiirasana. As the
diaphragm is being pressed, breathing will be hard and laboured. 'l'he
forearms do not bear the weight of the body as in Mayiirasana.
7. Exhale and rest the head and toes on the floor. Place the knees on
the floor by the side of the hands, take the weight of the body off the
elbows, raise the hands and the head from the floor and relax.
Effects
This asana tones the abdominal region of the body, because due to
the pressure of the elbows against the abdominal aorta, blood circulates
properly in the abdominal organs. This improves digestive power and
prevents the accumulation of toxins in the system. It develops and
strengthens the elbows, forearms and wrists.

Pi'nchii Mayurasana Twelve* (Plate 357)

Pincha means the chin or a feather. Mayiira means a peacock. At the
approach of the rainy season peacocks dance. When they start they
lift up their trailing tail feathers and spread them to form fans. In this
posture, the trunk and legs are lifted off the floor and the body is
balanced on the forearms and palms. The pose resembles that of a
peacock starting his dance.

The pose is given below in two stages : in the second, the hands are
lifted from the floor and the palms cupped under the chin, while the
balance is maintained only on the elbows. The second stage is known
as S ayanasana. (Plate 358)
Technique
1 . Kneel on the floor. Bend forward and rest the elbows, forearms
and palms on the floor. The distance between the elbows should not
be wider than that between the shoulders. Keep the forearm:; and
hands parallel to each other.
2. Stretch the neck and lift the head up as high as possible.
3· Exhale, swing the legs up and try to balance without dropping the
legs behind the head. (Plate 357)

357
4· Stretch the region of the chest up vertically. Keep the legs
stretched up vertically and together at the knees and ankles. The toes
should point up.
5· Tighten the leg muscles at the hips and knees. While balancing,
stretch the shoulders up and keep the thighs taut. Balance for a

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

287

minute. This is the first stage. In the beginning, try to get the balance
by doing the pose against a wall so that you do not topple over.
Gradually learn to stretch the spine and shoulders and to keep the
head up and after mastering the balance do the pose in the middle of
the room.
6. After perfecting the first stage, when the balance is secured lift the
hands one by one from the floor, join the wrists and cupping the
palms, place them under the chin. The body is balanced in this second
stage of the posture only on the elbows. This is difficult, but by deter­
mined and regular practice one can achieve it. This second stage is
known as the posture of repose :
1 3 1 . Sayanasana Fifteen* (Plate 358)
Effects
The posture develops the muscles of the shoulders and back. It tones
the spine and stretches the abdominal muscles.
1 32. Adho Mukha Vrk�asana Ten* (Plate 359)
Adho Mukha means having the face downwards. Vrk�a means a tree.
The pose is the full arm balance in modem gymnastics.
Technique
I . Stand in Ta�asana. (Plate 1 .) Bend forward and place the palms
on the floor about a foot away from a wall. The distance between
the palms should be the same as between the shoulders. Keep the
arms fully stretched.
2. Take the legs back and bend the knees. Exhale, swing the legs up
against the wall and balance. If the hands are kept far from the wall,
then when the legs are supported by the wall the curvature of the
spine will be great and will cause much strain. It will also be difficult
to balance if the hands are kept away from the wall. Stay in the pose
for a minute with normal breathing.
3· After learning to balance on the hands against the wall, take the
feet away from the wall. Then try the pose in the middle of the room.
Keep the legs fully stretched and the toes pointing up. Lift the head
as far up as you can. (Plate 359)
Effects
The pose develops the body ha;�nniously. It strengthens the
shoulders, arms and wrists and expands the chest fully.

288

359
1 33. Kurmasana Fourteen* (Plates 363 and 364)
Kiirma means a tortoise. The asana is dedicated to Kiirma the Tortoise
Incarnation of Vi�J?.U, the maintainer of the universe. Many divine
treasures had been lost in a universal flood including amrta (nectar)
with which the gods preserved their youth. To retrieve the lost treasures
the gods entered into an alliance with the demons and jointly under­
took to churn the cosmic ocean. Vi�l)U became a great tortoise and
dived to the bottom of the ocean. On his back was Mount Manqara
for the churning stick and round the mountain was twined the divine
serpent Vasuki for the rope. The ocean was churned by the joint efforts
of the gods and demons in pulling the snake and twirling the mountain.
From the churned ocean emerged amrta and various other treasures
including Lak�ml, consort of Vi�J?.U and the goddess of wealth and
beauty.
The pose is given in three stages. The final one resembles a tortoise
with head and limbs withdrawn under its shell and is called Supta
Kiirmasana (Plate 368), the sleeping tortoise pose.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77.)

Widen the lege; until the distance between the two knees is about a foot
and a half.
2. Bend the knees and lift them up by drawing the feet towards the
trunk.
3· Exhale, bend the trunk forward and insert the hands one by one
under the knees. (Plates 360 and 361.) Push the arms underneath the
knees and stretch them straight out sideways. Rest the shoulders on
the floor and keep the palms on it. (Plate 362.) Take a breath.
4· Exhale, stretch the trunk, still more, extend the neck and bring the
forehead, then the chin and lastly the chest down to the floor. Then
stretch the legs straight again. (Plates 363 and 364.) The knees will
then be near the armpits and the back of the knees will touch the back
of the upper arms near the armpits.
5· Gradually intensify the stretch until the chin and the chest rest on
the floor. Extend the legs fully also and press the heels down to the
floor. This is the first stage. Hold this position from 30 to 6o seconds.

6. Now turn the wrists so that the palms face up, and keeping the
legs, trunk and head in the same position, move the arms back from
the shoulders and stretch them straight so that the forearms are near
the hip joints. (Plate 365.) Stay in this position without bending the
elbows for 30 to 6o seconds. This is the second stage.
7· Bend and lift up the knees. Then lift the chest slightly off the
floor, move the hands behind the back by bending at the elbows and
clasp them. (Plate 366)
8. Now move the feet towards the head. Interlock the feet at the ankles
by placing the right foot over the left one or vice versa. (Plate 367)
9· Exhale, insert the head in between the feet and keep the forehead
on the floor. The back of the head will touch the interlocked feet
near the ankles. This is the final stage known as:
1 34· Supta Kurmasana Fourteen* (Plate 368)
Stay in this pose from one to two minutes. It is advisable to change
the position of the feet while interlocking them, so that if at first the
right foot is placed over the left one, when changing the position of

292

Light on Yoga

368

the feet place the left foot over the right one. This will develop the legs
evenly.

IO. Inhale, lift the head and release the hands and feet; stretch the

legs out straight, recline on the floor and relax.

I I. Breathe normally throughout the three stages described above.
Effects
This pose is sacred to a yogi. While describing the qualities of a
sthita-prajfia (one who is stable of mind) to Arjuna, the Blessed Lord
says : 'When, again as a tortoise draws its limbs in on all sides, he
withdraws his senses from the objects of sense, and then his under­
standing is well-poised.' (Bhagavad Gftii, second discourse, verse 58.)
In this pose the limbs are withdrawn and the body resembles a
tortoise. The mind becomes calm and composed and one develops
equanimity whether in sorrow or in joy. It will gradually become free
from anxiety amid pains and indifferent amid pleasures, while the
emotions of passion, fear and anger will loosen their hold upon the
mind.
On the purely physical level the effects are also great. It tones the
spine, activates the abdominal organs and keeps one energetic and
healthy. It soothes the nerves of the brain and after completing it one
feels refreshed as though one had woken up from a long undisturbed
sleep.
This as ana prepares the aspirant for the fifth stage of yogic practices,
namely, Pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses from outside objects).

left ankle and fold the palms in front of the chest. (Plate 371.) The
back of the left thigh will then touch the back of the left shoulder.
If the head is not held up properly, the leg will slip off the neck. The
right leg should lie straight on the floor. The back of the entire leg
should touch the floor and the toes point forward.

while the thighs and the hamstring muscles are stretched fully. The
abdominal muscles are contracted and the digestive power increases.
Until one has practised the posture one does not realise the weight
and pressure of the leg which rests on the neck.

I 36. Skandasana Sixteen* (Plate 372)
Skanda is the name of Kartikeya, the god of War, whose birth forms
the subject matter of Kumara-sambhava, the epic poem written by
Kalidasa. Once the gods were troubled by the demon Taraka, who it
was prophesied could only be destroyed by the son of Siva and
Parvatl, the beautiful daughter of the mountain Himalaya. But the
'

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

295

prospect of Siva having a son seemed to the other gods to be very
faint, because he was continually wrapped in meditation after the
death of his wife Sat1. Parvat1, who was the reincarnation of Sat1,
was sent by the gods to wait upon Siva, but though she made many
attempts to win his attention he took no notice of her. Vasanta, the
god of Spring, and Kama, the god of Love, did their best to help
Parvati to win S iva. Kama shot his arrow of desire at him and
disturbed him in his meditation. S iva opened his third eye and by the
flames issuing from it burnt Kama to ashes. In order to win her
husband of a former life, Parvat1 decided to follow S iva in asceticism.
She laid asic;ie her ornaments and became a hermitess on a nearby
peak, and in this guise, Siva, who had already been smitten by Kama's
i
arrow, noticed and fell in love with her. S iva and Parvat' were
i
married at a great ceremony, which all the gods attended. Parvat'
gave birth to the war-god Skanda, who when he grew to manhood,
slew the demon Taraka.

Effects of the asanas in the Eka Pada Sir�asana Cycle
The various movements in this cycle of asanas tone up the muscular,
nervous and circulatory systems of the entire body. The spine receives
a rich supply of blood, which increases the nervous energy in the
chakras (the various nerve plexuses situated in the spine), the fly­
wheels in the human body machine. These poses develop the chest and
make the breathing fuller and the body firmer; they stop nervous
trembling of the body and prevent the diseases which cause it; they
also help to eliminate toxins by supplying pure blood to every part of
the body and bringing the congested blood back to the heart and lungs
for purification. By the practice of these asanas the haemoglobin
content of the blood improves, the body and mind become vigorous and
the capacity for work increases.

Technique
1 . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the left leg at the knee and move it back. Place the left foot
by the hip joint, keep the toes pointing backwards and rest them on
the floor. The left leg will now be in Virasana. (Plate 89)

3 · Then follow the technique stated above for Viranchyasana I.
(Plate 386)
Effects
Both these poses strengthen the back and the neck while the shoulder
movements become freer. The thighs and hamstring muscles are
extended fully, the abdominal muscles contract and digestive power
mcreases.

ness. It is also the name given to the sleep of Visnu at the end of a
Yuga, an age of the world.
In this pose the legs are interlaced behind the back of the neck and
the hands are clasped behind the back which rests on the ground.
The legs form the Yogi's pillow and the back is his couch. The practice of
this pose warms up the body very rapidly. It is therefore used by Yogis
living at high altitudes to keep warm.
Technique
r . Lie flat on the back on the floor. (Plate 2 1 9)
2. Bend both the knees and bring the legs over the head.
3· Exhale, move the right leg from behind the right shoulder by
holding the right foot with both the hands and placing it well behind
the back of the neck, as in Eka Pacta Slr�asana. (Plate 389)
'

4· Maintain the position of the right leg, breathing in several times.
5· Exhale and with the help of the left palm move the left leg behind
the left shoulder and place it under the right leg. (Plate 390.) Lock
the feet at the ankles.
6. Lift the shoulders well up, move the arms behind the back and
clasp the fingers. (Plate 391.) The back of the upper arms will be in
contact with the back of the thighs. Take a few breaths.
7. Exhale, lift the chest well up and stretch the neck back. This is
the final position (which is the reverse position of Supta Kurmasana,
Plate 368). Stay in the pose for 30 to 6o seconds, trying to breathe

8. Exhale and release the hand grip behind the back and the leg grip
behind the neck.
9· Relax on the floor, keeping the legs straight for some time.
Then repeat the pose for the same length of time, first placing the
left leg behind the back of the neck with the right leg under it.
IO.

I1.

Loosen the hand and leg grips and relax on the floor.

I 2. Do not cross both legs first and then move them behind the neck.
This will not give the correct feel of the asana. Remember to bring
one leg behind the back of the neck and then the other leg under the
first one. Before resting the legs behind the neck, raise the neck and
dorsal region and also extend the shoulders, so that the latter do not
get wedged between the chest and the legs. This will ensure that the
pose is correct.

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

307

Effects
In this pose the spine is given a full forward stretch and one feels a
pleasing sensation in the back. It is one of the best front bending
poses. Even the maximum stretch of Paschimottanasana (Plate 1 60)
does not give the same feeling of right exercise, comfort and rest as
the correct practice of Yoganidrasana.
In the back bending poses the lungs and the abdominal muscles
are given maximum expansion. In this asana the lungs and the ab­
dominal muscles are contracted to the full. In a short time, the practice
of the pose tones the kidneys, liver, spleen, intestines, gall bladder,
prostates and the urine bladder. The abdominal organs will be free
from diseases by continued practice of this pose. It also exercises the
gonads and releases energy and vitality in the system. The nerves will
be rested and energy will be stored in the body for better thinking and
better work.
147. Dwi Pada Sir�asana Twenty-four* (Plate 393)
Dwi Pada (dwi = two or both; pada = leg or foot) means of both feet. In
Eka Pada Slrsasana (Plate 371) one leg is placed behind the back of the
neck. In this §sana both legs are so placed, the hands are folded in front
of the chest and the body is balanced on a small section of the seat near
the tail-bone. This is difficult and one is apt to fall backwards. The pose
is very similar to Yoganidrasana (Plate 391), but here the body is vertical,
whereas in Yoganidrasana the back rests on the floor.
Technique
'

I . Sit on the floor with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend both knees and bring the feet near the trunk.
3· Exhale, catch the right ankle with both hands, pull the right thigh
up and back, bend the trunk a little forward and place the right leg on
the back of the neck as in Eka Pada Si'r�asana. The back of the right
thigh will then touch the back of the right shoulder. Release the hands
from the ankle and take a few breaths.
4· Exhale, catch the left ankle with the left hand, pull the left thigh up

and back and place the left leg over the right one in the same manner
as described above. Release the hand from the left ankle, but keep the
feet locked at the ankles. Place the hands on the floor by the side of the
hips and balance upright on the portion of the seat near the tail-bone.
(Plate 392.) This requires practice. Try to maintain normal breathing.
5· Lift the hands off the floor, fold them in front of the chest and stay
0alanced in the vertical position for a few seconds or as long as you can
from 10 to 30 seconds. (Plate 393.) This is the final position.

6. After holding this posture, place the palms on the floor by the side of
the hips, exhale, straighten the arms and pull the body up by taking the
weight on the hands. Do not release the ankle lock. (Plate 394.) Hold
the pose from 1 0 to 20 seconds to your capacity.
7· Release the foot lock at the ankles, stretch the legs up vertically and
balance on the hands. This is called:
148. Tittibhiisana Twenty-two* (Plate 395)
Tittibha is an insect like a firefly.
After staying in this position for a few seconds, bend the legs at the
knees, lower the body to the floor, release the legs from the arms, stretch
them straight in front and rest for a few seconds.
8. Repeat the movements for the same length of time, this time first
placing the left leg on the back of the neck and then the right leg on the
top of the left one. Finally relax on the floor.
Effects
In this asana the lungs and abdominal muscles are most tightly con­
tracted. The spine is given a full forward stretch and the abdominal
organs benefit quickly from the exercise. The effect is the same as that
of Yoganidrasana (Plate 391 ), but in this pose the thighs are stretched

more and greater strain is felt on the neck, the sacrolumbar region of
the spine and the abdomen.

of kings and the author of several Vedic hymns, particularly of the
seventh Ma!f<;fala of the �g Veda. He was a typical representative of the
brahmanic dignity and power and is one of the seven sages who are
identified with the stars of the Great Bear. The rivalry between him
and the royal sage Visvamitra, a k�atriya (a man of the warrior caste) who
by his piety and asceticism raised himself to brahman status, forms the
subject of many legends.
The asana is dedicated to the sage Vasi�!ha.
Technique
1 . Stand in Ta<;iasana. (Plate 1.) Bend forward, rest the palms on the
floor and take the legs back about 4 to 5 feet as if you are doing Adho
Mukha Svanasana. (Plate 75)

2. Turn the whole body sideways to the right and balance on the right
hand and foot only. The outer side of the right foot should rest firmly
on the floor. Place the left foot over the right one, rest the left palm on
the left hip and balance, keeping the body straight. (Plate 396.) In order
to learn the art of balancing in this position, be close to a wall so that
the inner side of the right foot rests against it.

396

3· Exhale, bend the left leg at the knee, move the body slightly forward
and catch the left big toe between the thumb and the index and middle
fingers of the left hand. (Plate 397.) Pull the left arm and the left leg up
vertically. (Plate 398.) The grip on the toe will be like that described in
Supta Padangusthasana. (Plate 284.) Balance in this position, keeping
the arms and legs rigid, with deep breathing, for about 20 to 30 seconds.
4· Release the toe grip, rest the left leg again over the right foot and
lower the left hand to the hip once more.
5· Exhale, turn the body over to the left so that it balances only on the

Effects
This pose strengthens the wrists, exercises the legs and tones the lumbar
and coccyx regions of the spine.
150. Kasyapasana Nineteen* (Plates 399 and 400)
This asana is dedicated to the sage Kasyapa, son of the sage Marfchi, a
son of Brahma. He bore an important share in the work of creation. It
is said that Kasyapa married the thirteen daughters of Dak�a. He begot
by Aditi the twelve Adityas (the gods) and by Diti the Daityas (the

312

demons). By his other wives he had diversified and numerous progeny
such as serpents, reptiles, birds and nymphs of the lunar constellations.
He was thus the father of Siirya (the sun god) and all living beings
and is often called Prajapati (the Progenitor).

2. Turn the whole body sideways to the right and balance on the right
hand and foot. The outer side of the right foot should rest firmly on the
floor. Place the left foot over the right foot, rest the left palm on the left
hip and balance keeping the body straight. (Plate 396)
3· Exhale, bend the left knee and place the left foot at the root of the
right thigh as in half Padmasana. Swing the left arm from the shoulder
behind the back and with the left hand catch the left big toe. This is the
final position. (Plates 399 and 400.) Balance in it for some time with
deep breathing. The entire chest and the extended right arm should be
in one plane.

4· Exhale, release the left foot, place it again over the right one and put

the left hand on the left thigh. (Plate 396.) Take a few deep breaths.
5· Exhale, turn the body over to the left so that it balances only on the

left hand and foot. Place the right foot at the root of the left thigh in
half Padmasana and catch the right big toe from behind the back with
the right hand. Balance on the both sides for an equal length of time.

1 5 1 . Vi'sviimi'trasana Twenty* (Plate 403)

Visvamitra was the name of a celebrated sage. He was originally a
k�atriya (a member of the warrior caste), being the king of Kanyakubja.
One day while out hunting, he went to the hermitage of the sage
Vasi�!ha, and seeing there Kamadhenu (the Cow of Plenty), offered the
sage untold treasures in exchange for her. On being refused, the king
tried to take her by force. A long contest ensued in which the king was
defeated. Although sorely vexed, he was greatly impressed with the
power inherent in Brahmanism. The king devoted himself to the most
rigorous austerities until he successively achieved the status and titles
ofRaja�i (a royal sage, a saint-like prince), Ri�i (a sage or seer), Maha�i
(a great sage or patriarch of mankind) and finally Brahmarsi (a
Brahmanical sage), but he was not content until Vasi�!ha himself called
him Brahmarsi.
. During his arduous penance, the heavenly nymph
Menaka seduced him and conceived Sakuntala, the heroine of Kalidasa's
famous drama.
This asana is dedicated to Visvamitra.

Dhanurasana.
.

Effects
The spine is stretched fully and the effect of Paschimottanasana (Plate
1 60) is gained in a very short time. The arms and the abdominal organs
will grow strong.
All these intricate and difficult positions bring results quicker than
the simple ones. When the body becomes more pliable, the simple poses
will have little or no effect. The wise therefore discard them and practise
the intricate poses just as a scholar will not repeat the alphabet daily.
But, just as dancers daily practise some basic steps and do no� discard
them, so also pupils of yoga should continue daily to perform Slr�asana
(Plates 1 84 to 2 1 8) and Sarvangasana with their cycles. (Plates 234 to
27 1 )

41 3·) After securing steadiness, exhale, turn the trunk to the right (Plate
420) and lower the legs so that the left thigh rests on the back of the
upper right arm. (Plate 421.) Secure this position and balance for some
time with even but fast breathing due to the lateral twist of the trunk.

3· The pose is a difficult one, the hardest part being to place the thigh
on the opposite hand. In the beginning one finds it difficult to balance
while securing the proper placing of the thigh and one often sits down
on the floor with a hard bump.
4· Exhale, press the hands firmly on the ground, raise the head from
the floor (Plate 422) and pull the trunk. (Plate 423.) Stretch and
straighten the arms and lift up the buttocks. Extend the neck forwards
and hold the head up as high as possible. (Plate 424)
5· This is the final position. Balance the body on the hands for a few
seconds as long as you can. Greater strain will be felt on the left arm
which is apparently free.
6. Exhale, bend the elbows, lower the head to the floor and go up
again to Sfr�asana I I . Then release the foot lock of Padmasana.
,

,

7· Rest for a while in Sfrsasana. Move into Padmasana again, this
time by placing first the left foot at the root of the right thigh and
then the right foot at the root of the left thigh. Then repeat the pose
on the left side. (Plate 425.) Here the right thigh will rest on the back

324

422

423

424

of the upper left arm. While balancing the body on the left side it is
necessary to change the position of the legs in Padmasana. If they are
not changed, it is extremely difficult to rest the thigh on the back of
the opposite upper arm.
8. Stay for the same length of time on both sides.
9· After perfecting the positions as explained above in paras 4 and 7
an attempt may be made, without releasing the foot lock in para. 6,
to turn the body to the left, rest the right thigh on the upper left arm,
raise the head from the floor and balance. (Plate 424a)

IO. Go back to Sfr�asana I I . Then after completing the pose from
para. 7 without changing the crossed leg by turning the body to the
right, attempt to place the left thigh on the upper right arm, raise
the head from the floor and balance. (Plate 425a)
I 1 . Hold the pose for the same length of time on all occasions. Then
go back to Slrsasana I I , lower the legs to the floor and relax. Or
perform Urdhva Dhanurasana (Plate 486) and then stand up in
Ta<:fasana. (Plate 1 .) When one has mastered Viparlta Chakrasana
(Plates 488 to 499) this is an exhilarating exercise after practising
U rdhva Dhanurasana.

Effects
In addition to the benefit one secures from Urdhva Kukkutasana
(Plate 4 I 9), in this variation the spine receives a lateral twist and is
toned. The chest, arms and the abdominal muscles and organs
become stronger and vital power increases.

and chest.
3· Take a few breaths, turn the trunk to the right and with an
exhalation lower the folded legs to where the shins cross on the back
of the right upper arm as near the armpit as possible. (Plate 426.)
Secure the position, take a few deep breaths and balance.

4· Exhale, pull the body up by ratsmg the head from the floor,
tighten the muscles near the diaphragm, straighten the arms, balance
on the hands (Plate 427) and stay in this position for a few seconds
up to your capacity. In this pose greater strain will be felt on the left
shoulder and arm, which are apparently free.
5· Bend the elbows, rest the head on the floor and again go up to
SaJamba S'ir�asana I I without releasing the foot lock of Padmasana.
6. Exhale, bend the trunk, rest the legs on the back of the upper
left arm and balance as you did on the right. (Plate 428)

Effects
By continued practice of this pose, the wrists and the abdominal
organs will grow stronger and the lateral muscles of the abdomen will

Effects
This asana exercises Miiladhara Chakra, the prostate gland and gonads.
It also has the wonderful effect of controlling excessive sexual desire
and helps to save energy. It therefore controls and stills the mind.
'The mind is the lord of the Indriyas (organs of the senses); Pr�a
is the lord of the mind ; Laya or absorption is the lord of Pra�a ; and
that Laya depends on Nada (the inner sounds). When the mind is
absorbed, it is called Mok�a (emancipation) ; but others say that it is
not: however, when the PraJ?a and Manas (the mind) have been
absorbed, an undefinable joy ensues.' (Ha?ha Yoga Pradipikii, 4th
chapter, verses 29 and 30.)
Baddhakonasana (Plate 101) and Miilabandhasana are a great help
to people with excess�ve sexual desire. When this desire is controlled,
energy is sublimated and real joy of life is limitless.

he was the friend and devoted servant of Rama, the seventh incarna­
tion of Vi��u. When Rama, his wife Slta and his brother Lak�ma�a
forest, Ravana,
the demon
were in exile as hermits in the Dandaka
.
.
king of Lanka (Ceylon), came to their hermitage in the guise of an
ascetic and seizing Slta carried her off to Lanka while Rama and
Lak�maJ?.a were hunting game. The brothers searched far and wide for
Slta, and enlisted the help of Sugrlva, the king of the monkeys, and
his general Hanuman. Hanuman went in search of Slta, crossed the sea
by leaping over the straits, found her in Ravana's palace, and brought
the news to Rama. With . the aid of a great army of monkeys and
bears Rama built a causeway of stones across the sea to Lanka and
after a fierce battle slew Rava�a and his hosts and rescued Slta. During
the battle, Lak�ma�a had been struck by an arrow and lay un­
conscious and it was said that the only cure was the juice of a herb
which grew in the Himalayas. With one prodigious leap Hanuman
crossed the sea and reached the Himalayas to bring back with him
the mountain top on which the life-giving plant grew and thus saved
the life of Laksmana.
. This asana is dedicated to Hanuman and commemorates his fabulous leaps. It is practised by going down on the
floor with the legs spread out laterally while the hands are folded m
front of the chest. It resembles the splits of Western ballet.

stretch the legs further and further until you sit on the floor with
both legs spread sideways in a straight line. The entire back of the
legs, especially the back of the knees, should rest on the floor.
3· Join the palms in front of the chest (Plate 477) and stay in the pose
for a few seconds.
4· Place the palms on the floor, raise the hips and bring the legs closer

477

356

and closer to each other until you stand up again in Uttanasana. (Plate
47.) Then stand in Tasfasana (Plate I ) and relax.
Effects
In this pose the hip joints are exercised and the legs are made to move
freely in all directions. The spine is stretched and any defect in the
lower part of the spine is cured. The pose, like Hanumanasana (Plate
475), tones the leg muscles and makes the legs shapely. It prevents
the development of hernia and relieves sciatic pains. It helps the blood
to circulate in the pelvic region and genital organs and keeps them
healthy.
I 7 I . Supra Trivikramasana Thirty-nine* (Plate 478)
Supta means reclining. Trivikrama (tri = three; vikrama = a step, stride
or pace) is a name of Visnu. The asana is dedicated to Vamanavatar,
the Dwarf Incarnation of Vi��u. It is said that Bali, the grandson of
Prahlada, who was the king of the demons, gained control of the world.
Bali practised asceticism by which his power so increased that he
threatened even the gods who prayed to Vi��u for help. The god
descended on earth and was born as the dwarf son of the Brahman
sage Kasyapa and his wife Aditi. At one of the sacrifices performed by
Bali, Vi��u appeared before him in the form of a dwarf (Vamana) and
asked for as much earth as he could cover in three strides. Bali, who
was noted for his liberality, unhesitatingly granted this boon. There­
upon, the Dwarf assumed a mighty form, and made three strides. The
first covered the earth, and the second the heavens. As there was no
other place for the third stride, Bali offered his own head on which
the Lord planted his foot. He then sent him and all his legions to
Patala, the nether regions, and allowed him to be its ruler. The universe
was thus once more restored to the gods.
This asana is more difficult than Hanumanasana. (Plate 475.) Here,
the pose is performed by lying on the floor on the back, then doing
the splits and holding the heel of one foot near the head, while the
other heel rests on the floor.
Technique
I . Lie fiat on the back on the floor, keeping both legs straight. (Plate
2I9)
2. Raise the right leg up. Interlock the fingers, stretch the arms and
hold the right heel in the cup of the hands.
3· Exhale, pull the right leg straight down behind the head and place
the right big toe on the floor, without letting go of the heel. (Plate

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

357

478.) The inner side of the right calf will touch the right ear and the
elbows will be widened slightly. The left leg should remain straight
on the floor throughout.

478
4· Remain in the pose as long as you conveniently can with normal
breathing.
5· Release the right heel and lower the right leg beside the left one.
6. Repeat the pose for an equal length of time, now holding the left
heel and keeping the right leg on the floor.
1· After finishing this strenuous pose, rest for a while and relax.

Effects
In this pose, the legs are fully stretched. It prevents and cures hernia.
It also lessens sexual desire and thereby stills the mind.
172. Urdhva Dhanurasana I Seven* (Plate 482)
U rdhva means upwards. Dhanu means a bow. In this posture the
body is arched back and supported on the palms and soles.
Technique (This is for beginners)

2. Bend and raise the elbows over the head, and place the palms under
the shoulders. The distance between the palms should not be wider
than the shoulders and the fingers should point towards the feet.
3· Bend and raise the knees, then bring the feet nearer until they touch
the hips. (Plate 479)
4· Exhale, raise the trunk and rest the crown of the head on the floor.
(Plate 480.) Take two breaths.

4�1

5· Now exhale, lift the trunk and head and arch the back so that its
weight is taken on the palms and the soles. (Plate 481)
6. Stretch the arms from the shoulders until the elbows are straight­
ened, at the same time pulling the thigh muscles up. (Plate 482)

Yogiisanas, Bandha and Kriyii

359

482
7. To get a better stretch, exhale and pull the thigh muscles still
higher by lifting the heels off the floor. Extend the chest, stretch up
the sacral region of the spine until the abdomen is taut as a drum and
then lower the heels to the floor, maintaining the stretch of the spine.
8. Remain in this position from half a minute to a minute, with normal
breathing.
9· With an exhalation, lower the body to the floor by bending the knees
and elbows.
172a. Ordhva Dhanuriisana II Fifteen* (Plate 486)
Technique (This is for intermediate pupils)
I. Stand erect with the feet one foot apart and the palms on the hips.
2 . Push the pelvic region slightly forward (Plate 483), exhale and curve
the trunk back so that the weight of the body is felt on the thighs and
the toes. (Plate 484)
3· Raise the arms above the head and drop the hands on to the floor.
(Plate 485.) Immediately try to straighten the arms at the elbows and
rest the palms on the floor. (Plate 486.) If the elbows are not stretched
immediately as the palms touch the floor, one is likely to bang the head.

4· After securing the above position stretch the legs and arms straight.
(Plate 487)

487
5· While learning the pose this way it is helpful to use a friend or a
wall. Stand about three feet from a wall with your back to it. Curve the
back and move the head towards the wall. Raise the arms over the head
and rest the palms on the wall. Push the pelvis forward so that the body
weight is felt on the thighs and move the palms down the wall until
you touch the floor. Use the wall for coming up in a similar manner.
After mastering this, only use the wall until you are half-way up. Then
learn to do the asana in the middle of the room.
173. Vipar"ita Chakrasana in Urdhva Dhanurasana. Twenty-six* (Plates
488 to 499)
Technique (This is for advanced pupils)
I . Stand erect. Bend forward and place the palms on the floor. Exhale
and swing both legs up as though you were doing the full arm balance
(Plate 359), bend the knees, arch the back and drop the legs behind the
head. (Plate 486)

2. While the legs are coming down beyond and behind the head, con­
tract the hips, extend the back up, stretch the ribs and abdomen and
straighten the arms at the elbows. Unless you do this, you will sit on the
floor with a bump.
3· When all this has been mastered, learn the reverse swinging move­
ments of the leg as shown from Plates 488 to 499, so that one swings
the legs up and back in a reverse somersault movement. This reverse
somersault into the forward bending position is called Viparita

362

Light on Yoga

Chakrasana, the reversed wheel pose. (Vipar!ta = reverse, contrary,
opposite, inverted ; chakra = wheel.) Most people, however, can only
learn to do it with the aid of a competent teacher.

4· If, however, no guru is available and you have confidence in yourself,
you can try to achieve the reverse somersault movement in the following
manner. Do Urdhva Dhanurasana near a wall so that the feet face the
wall about a foot away from it. Swing the trunk with an exhalation
towards the shoulders so that the weight of the body is borne on the
wrists and shoulders. Then lift one leg from the floor and place the foot
on the wall at the height of about two feet. Press and push against the
wall with that foot, lift the other leg off the floor and with an exhalation
swing the legs over the head, making a reverse somersault. After
repeated attempts, you will gain confidence. You will learn to rock the
body forward and backward and to swing the trunk towards the
shoulders with a backward movement of the legs in the reverse somer­
sault. When you are sure of taking the legs off the floor, then try
Vipar'ita Chakrasana in the middle of the room away from the wall. This
is how I learnt the reverse somersault movements in Viparita Chakrasana.
Effects
This as ana is the beginning of the advanced and difficult back -bending
poses. It tones the spine by stretching it fully and keeps the body alert
and supple. The back feels strong and full of life. It strengthens the
arms and wrists and has a very soothing effect on the head. Once Viparita
Chakrasana is mastered, it can be repeated several times a day. It gives
one great vitality, energy and a feeling of lightness.
I74· Eka Piida Urdhva Dhanuriisana Twelve* (Plates 501 and 502)

this position from r o to 1 5 seconds, with normal breathing.
4· Exhale, lower the hands and raised leg and go back to Urdhva

Dhanurasana.
5. Repeat the pose by lifting the left leg and placing the left hand on
the left thigh, balancing the body on the right hand and leg. (Plate 502.)

Breathing will be very fast and laboured as the diaphragm is fully
contracted.
5. Take a few quick breaths, exhale, raise the pelvic region by tightening
the muscles of the thighs. Gradually bring the hands near the heels and
catch them by bringing the head towards the feet. Now place the crown
of the head on the soles of the feet. (Plate 507)

6. Stay in the pose for a few seconds. Gradually increase the time
according to your capacity up to a minute.
7· Exhale, release the grip on the feet and lower the head and body until
you are again in Supta Vldisana. (Plate 95.) Straighten the legs one by
one and relax on the floor.
Technique (For advanced pupils)

6. Release the grip on the feet. Extend the arms and bring the body
forward until you are again standing on the knees. Then rest on the
floor and relax.
Effects
The pose tones up the entire spinal region as the blood is made to
circulate well round the spinal column. Since the pelvic region is
stretched, the genital organs keep healthy. The diaphragm is lifted up
and this massages the heart gently and helps to strengthen it. The chest
expands fully. It is essential to master Kapotasana before practising the
more difficult back-bending poses, which cannot be done until you have
perfected Kapotasana and Vipar!ta Dan9asana (Plate 5 I 6) to Man9-alasana. (Plates 525 and 535)
I 76.

Laghu Vajriisana Twenty-three* (Plate 5 I 3)

Laghu means little, small, easy as well as lovely, handsome, beautiful.
Vajra means a thunderbolt, the weapon of I ndra, the king of gods.
Technique
I. Kneel on the floor with the knees and feet together. Rest the palms
on the sides of the waist. (Plate 40)
2. Exhale, arch the spine back and at the same time tighten the muscles
of the thighs. (Plates 508 and 509)
3· Push the hips forward and keep bending the spine back until the
crown of the head rests on the feet. It requires great practice to achieve
the necessary spinal elasticity. The weight of the body is borne only on
the knees.
When the. above position is achieved, remove the hands from the
waist, stretch the arms straight from the shoulders and grip each knee
with the respective hand. (Plate 5 I 3)

4·

5· Due to the spine being stretched and the pressure against the
abdomen, breathing will be fast and laboured. Try to hold the pose from
IO to I 5 seconds while breathing normally.
6. Exhale, keep the knees firm, raise the head and trunk until you are
kneeling again. Then sit on the floor and rest.
Effects
This asana tones the spinal nerves and exercises the coccyx (the terminal
triangular bone of the vertebral column). The pose, if practised
regularly, relieves pain and disc displacements in the lower region of the
spine. Due to the arch, the abdominal muscles and chest are fully
extended.

7 . The diaphragm being contracted, breathing will be fast and short.
Take a few breaths, exhale and raise the shoulders as high as you can
above the floor, as also the chest, trunk, hips, thighs and calves. Stretch
the legs straight from the pelvis to the ankles. Dig the heels into the
floor and stay in this position to your capacity from one to two minutes.

lock, raise the head from the floor, lower the trunk and relax.
9· The neck, chest and shoulders should be fully extended and the
pelvic region raised as high as possible above the floor. To start with
the neck will not stay perpendicular to the floor as it should and there
will be a tendency for the head and forearms to slip away. So rest the
feet against a wall and ask a friend to press down the elbows until the
distance between the feet and the head on the floor is properly adjusted
while the spine and legs are fully extended.

Miiladhara Chakra (the pelvic plexus); (2) Svadhi��hana Chakra (the
hypogastric plexus); (3) Mar:tipiiraka Chakra (the solar plexus); (4)
Anahata Chakra (the <:_ardiac plexus) ; (5) Visuddha Chakra (the
pharyngeal plexus); (6) Ajiia Chakra (the plexus of command between
the two eyebrows); and (7) Sahasrara Chakra (the thousand petalled
lotus, the upper cerebral centre). The chakras are subtle and not easily
cognisable. Though they are here compared to the various plexi, it
should not be taken for granted that the plexi alone are the chakras.

182. Vrschikasana I Thirty-two* (Plates 536 and 537)
Vrschika means a scorpion. In order to sting its victim the scorpion
arches its tail above its back and then strikes beyond its head. This
posture resembles that of a striking scorpion, hence the name.
Technique
I. Kneel on the floor, bend forward and rest the elbows, forearms and
palms on the floor parallel to each other. The distance between the
forearms should not be wider than that between the shoulders.
2. Extend the neck and lift the head as high as you can above the floor.
3· Exhale, swing the legs and trunk up and try to balance without
dropping the legs beyond the head. Stretch the region of the chest up
vertically, keeping the arms from the elbows to the shoulders per­
pendicular to the floor. Stretch the legs up vertically and balance. This
is Pincha Mayurasana. (Plate 357)
4· After balancing on the forearms, exhale, bend the knees, raise the
neck and head as high as you can above the floor, stretch the spine from
the shoulders and lower the feet until the heels rest on the crown of
the head. (Front view : Plate 536.) After you have learnt this, try to keep
the knees and ankles together and the toes pointing. (Side view : Plate
537.) From the heels to the knees, the legs should be perpendicular to
the head. The shins and the upper arms should be parallel to each
other.
5 · As the neck, shoulders, chest, spine and abdomen are all extended in
this pose, breathing will be very fast and heavy. Try to breathe normally
and stay in this posture as long as you can for about 30 seconds.
6. After holding the pose to your capacity, drop the legs to the floor
beyond the �ead, lift the elbows from the floor and straighten the arms

7· Then, either stand up in Ta<;tasana (Plate I ) or do Vipar'ita
Chakrasana. (Plates 488 to 499)
8. To relieve the strain on the back caused by Vrschikasana, bend
forward and touch the palms on the floor without bending the knees­
Uttanasana. (Plate 48)

1 . Stand in Ta�Hisana. (Plate 1 . ) Bend forward and place the palms on
the floor. The distance between them should be the same as that between
the shoulders. Keep the arms fully stretched.
2. Lift the legs and bend the knees. Exhale, swing the trunk and legs
up vertically and balance on the hands. Lift the neck and head as high
as possible above the floor. This is Adho Mukha Vrk�asana. (Plate 359)
3· After securing the balance, exhale, bend the knees, stretch the spine
and chest and lower the feet till the heels rest on the crown of the head.
Keep the toes pointing. When balancing try to keep the knees and ankles
joined. The shins should b e perpendicular to the head and the arms to
the floor. The shins and arms should b e parallel to each other. (Plate
53 8)
4· It is extremely difficult to balance in this pose, which is much harder
to perform than doing it as described earlier in Piilcha Mayiirasana.
(Plate 537)
5· It requires tremendous strength of the wrists and determined and
continued effort to master this asana. Breathing will be fast and laboured
because the neck, shoulders, chest and spine are extended and the

388

538
abdomen is contracted. Try to maintain normal breathing and stay in
the pose as long as you can from 10 to 1 5 seconds.
6. Then drop the legs to the floor beyond the head to perform Urdhva
Dhanudisana (Plate 486) and either stand up in Tac;tasana (Plate 1 ) or
perform Viparita Chakrasana. (Plates 488 to 499)
7. To get relief from the strain on the back caused by Vrschikasana,

bend forward and touch the palms on the floor without bending the
knees - Uttanasana. (Plate 48)
Effects
The lungs expand fully while the abdominal muscles are stretched. The
entire spine is vigorously toned and remains healthy. The asana has also
psychological significance. The head which is the seat of knowledge and
power is also the seat of pride, anger, hatred, jealousy, intolerance and
malice. These emotions are more deadly than the poison which the
scorpion carries in its sting. The yogi, by stamping on his head with
his feet, attempts to eradicate these self-destroying emotions and pas­
sions. By kicking his head he seeks to develop humility, calmness and
tolerance and thus to be free of ego. The subjugation of the ego leads
to harmony and happiness.

1 84. Eka Piida Riijakapotiisana I Twenty-eight* (Plate 542)
Eka means one, pada the leg or foot and kapota a dove or pigeon.
Rajakapota means the king of pigeons. In this asana, the chest is pushed
forward like that of a pouter pigeon, hence the name of the pose.
Technique
1 . Sit on the floor, with the legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the right knee and place the right foot on the floor so that the
right heel touches the left groin. Keep the right knee on the floor.
3· Take the left leg back and rest its entire length straight on the floor.
The front of the left thigh, knee and shin and the upper part of the
toes of the left foot will then touch the floor.
4· Place the palms on the waist, push the chest forward, stretch the neck,
throw the head as far back as possible and balance for some time in
this preparatory movement of the pose. (Plate 539)

539

5· Now rest the hands on the floor in front, bend the left knee and lift
the left foot up near to the head. The left leg from the knee to the
ankle should be perpendicular to the floor and to achieve this, tighten the
muscles of the left thigh.
6. With an exhalation, take the right arm over the head and grip the
left foot with the right hand. (Plate 540.) Take a few breaths. Then
exhale again and catch the left foot with the left hand. Rest the head
against the left foot. (Plate 541)

542.) Stay in the pose for about 10 seconds. As the chest is expanded
fully while the abdomen is contracted, breathing will be fast. Try and
breathe normally.
8. Release the grip of the hands on the left ankle one by one and place
the palms on the floor. Straighten the left leg and bring it in front, then
straighten the right leg.
9· Repeat the pose on the other side for the same length of time. This
time the left foot will touch the right groin, the right leg will be stretched
back and the right foot will be caught by extending both arms over the
head.

1 85 . Valakhilyasana Forty-five* (Plate 544)
The Valakhilya were heavenly spirits the size of a thumb, produced from
the Creator's body. They are said to precede the Sun's chariot and to
number sixty thousand. They are referred to in Kalidasa's epic poem
RaghuvariJ,sa. This difficult asana is a continuation of Eka Pada
Rajakapotasana I. (Plate 542.) (Do not attempt it until you have
mastered Eka Pada Rajakapotasana I and can perform the latter com­
fortably and gracefully.)
Technique
1 . Perform Eka Pada Rajakapotasana I . (Plate 542.) After gripping the
left ankle firmly with both the hands, contract the hips and move the
coccyx up. Without releasing the ankle, stretch the left leg back (Plate
543) and take a few breaths.

543
2. Exhale, extend the arms further and push the leg down until it lies
fiat on the floor. The entire front of the leg from the thigh to the toes
should touch the floor. (Plate 544)

392

3· Stay in the pose for a few seconds. As the chest is fully extended
while the abdominal organs are contracted, breathing will be fast and
laboured.
4· Release the ankle grip, straighten the back and rest for a while.
5· Repeat the pose on the other side for the same length oftime.
Effects
.

The pose is a counter movement of Janu Slr�asana (Plate I 27) and it
rejuvenates the lower region of the spine. I n it more blood circulates
round the pubic region, keeping it in a healthy condition. By practising
this and other poses of the Rajakapotasana cycle, disorder of the urinary
system is rectified. The neck and shoulder muscles are exercised fully.
The thyroids, parathyroids, adrenals and gonads receive a rich supply
of blood and this increases one's vitality. This and other asanas of the
Rajakapotasana cycle are reGommended for controlling sexual desire.
I 86. Eka Piida Rajakapotiisana II Twenty-nine* (Plate 545)

Technique
1 . Sit on the floor, with legs stretched straight in front. (Plate 77)
2. Bend the right knee and place the sole and heel of the right foot fiat
on the floor. The s.hin of the right leg will then be almost perpendicular
to the floor and the calf will touch the back of the thigh. Place the
right heel near the perineum. The right leg will now be in Marlchyasana
I . (Plate I44)
3· Take the left leg back and rest the entire length of it on the floor.

to the floor and the shin is almost at an angle of 40 degrees to the floor.

545
5· With an exhalation, take the right arm over the head and grip the
left foot firmly with the right hand. Take a few breaths and after
exhaling again take the left arm over the head and catch the same foot
with the left hand as well. Rest the head on the foot. (Plate 545)
6. Push the chest forward and hold the pose for about I 5 seconds.
7· Due to the extension of the chest and contraction of the abdomen
breathing will be fast. Try to keep it normal.
8. Release the grip on the ankles and straighten the legs.
9· Repeat the pose on the other side. This time the left leg will be in
'

Marichyasana I, the right foot will be caught by the hands and the
balance maintained while the head rests on it. Hold the pose for the
same length of time on both sides.
ro. This asana is easier than the earlier one, once the difficulty of
balancing in it is overcome.

2. Bend the left leg at the knee so that the toes point back and touch the
floor by the left buttock. The inner side of the left calf should touch
the outer side of the left thigh and the left knee should be kept on the
floor. The left leg will not be in V:frasana. (Plate 89)
3· Take the right leg back and rest its entire length straight on the floor.
4· Place the palms on the floor. Exhale, bend the right knee and take
the right foot up near the head. The right shin from knee to ankle should
be perpendicular to the floor and to get this position, tighten the muscles
of the right thigh. Take a few breaths.
5· Exhale, stretch the spine and neck, throw the head back and taking
the arms one by one over the head grip the right foot and rest the head
on it. (Plate 546.) Balance for about I 5 seconds and try to breathe
normally.

6. Release the grip on the right ankle and straighten the legs.
7· Repeat the pose for the same length of time on the other side. Now

The legs will now be in Hanumanasana (Plate 475), which resembles the
splits of Western ballet.
2. Push the chest forward, extend the neck and throw the head as far
back as you can. Bend the left knee and take the left foot up near the
head. The left shin from knee to ankle should be perpendicular to the

straight on the floor in front. Bend the right knee and take the right foot
up near the head.
6. Repeat the pose by catching the right foot and resting the head on it.
Stay for the same length of time on this side.
Effects of the Eka Piida Riijakapotiisana Cycle
These poses rejuvenate the lumbar and dorsal regions of the spine. The
neck and shoulder muscles are fully exercised and the various positions
of the legs strengthen the thighs and ankles. The thyroids, parathyroids,
adrenals and gonads receive a rich supply of blood and function
properly, which increases vitality. In these poses more blood circulates
round the pubic region, which is kept healthy. These asanas are recom­
mended for disorders of the urinary system and for controlling sexual
desire.

I 89. Bhujangiisana II Thirty-seven* (Plate 550)
Bhujailga means a serpent. This pose is preparatory to Rajakapotasana
(Plate 55 I), and resembles that of a serpent about to strike.
Technique

I . Lie flat on the floor on the stomach. Bend the elbows and place the

palms on the floor on either side of the waist.

2 . Exhale, lift the head and trunk up and back, by stretching the arms
fully, without moving the pubic region and the legs. (Plate 73)
3· Remain in this position breathing normally for a few seconds.
4· Exhale, bend the knees and lift the feet up. The weight of the body
will be felt on the pelvic region, thighs and hands. Take a few breaths.
5· Taking more pressure on the right hand, lift the left hand off the
floor and with a deep exhalation swing the left arm back from the
shoulder and grasp the left knee-cap. (Plate 548.) After a few breaths
exhale again fast and deeply, and swinging the right arm back from the
shoulder, grip the right knee-cap with the right hand. (Plate 549)

6. Stretch the legs straight on the floor again without loosening the grip
on the knees. Stretch the neck and throw the head as far back as you
can. (Plate 550.) Gradually try to bring the knees as close to each other
as possible.
7. Contract the anus, tighten the thighs and hold the pose for about
I 5 to 20 seconds. As the spine, chest and shoulders are fully extended
while the abdomen is contracted, breathing is fast and difficult.

Yogiisanas, Bandha and Kriyii

8. Bend the knees, release the hands one by one from the knee-caps
and rest on the floor.
Effects
As the posture is an intensified version of Bhujailgasana I (Plate 73) its
effect is greater. Here the sacroiliac, lumbar and dorsal regions of the
spine benefit along with the neck and shoulder muscles which are fully
stretched. In this pose more blood circulates in the pubic region which
is kept healthy. The thyroids, parathyroids, adrenals and gonads receive
a copious supply of blood and this results in increased vitality. The
chest is also expanded fully.
1 90. Rajakapotasana Thirty-eight* (Plate 5 5 1 )
Rajakapota means the king of pigeons. This is a very attractive but

398

difficult pose. The chest is pushed forward like that of a strutting pigeon,
hence this name.
Technique
I . Lie full length on the floor on the stomach, bend the elbows and
place the palms on the floor on either side of the waist.
2. Exhale, lift the head and trunk up and back by stretching the arms

fully, without moving the pubic region and the legs. Remain in this
position for a few seconds, breathing normally.
3· Exhale, bend the knees and lift the feet up. The body weight will be
felt by the pelvic region and the thighs. Take a few breaths.
4· Taking pressure on the right hand, lift the left hand and with a fast
and deep exhalation swing the left arm back from the shoulder and catch
hold of the left knee-cap. (Plate 548.) Take a few breaths. Again with
a fast and deep exhalation, swing the right arm back from the shoulder
and grip the right knee-cap with the right hand. (Plate 549)
5 · Raise the chest and using the hold on the knees as a lever stretch the
spine and neck still further back until the head rests on the soles and
heels. Keep the feet together and the knees as close to each other as
possible. (Plate 55 r)

55 1
6. Maintain the pose as long as you can for about I 5 seconds. As the
spine and chest are fully extended while the abdomen is pressed against
the ground, breathing will be very fast and difficult and a stay of about
I 5 seconds will seem like an age. The pose closely resembles Laghu
Vajrasana (Plate 5 ! 3), the difference being that the body now rests on

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

399

the pelvic region and the thighs, instead of on the legs from the knees to
the toes.
7· Stretch the legs straight again. Let go of the knees and bring the
palms in front on the floor one by one. If both hands are released
simultaneously, due to the tension of the spine one is apt to fall on the
face and hurt oneself. After resting the palms one by one in front, rest
the chest on the floor and relax.
8. I f this is difficult, place the palms on the floor and rest the crown of
the head on the feet. (Plate 552)

55 2

Effects
In Kapotasana (Plate 5 1 2) the lumbar region of the spine feels the
stretch. In Rajakapotasana on the other hand, both the lumbar and the
dorsal regions of the spine benefit by it. The neck and shoulder muscles
are fully stretched and exercised. As the weight of the body falls on the
pubic region, more blood circulates there so that the region is kept
healthy. The abdominal organs are pressed against the floor and so are
massaged. The thyroids, parathyroids, adrenals and the gonads receive
a copious and rich supply of blood and this ensures increased vitality.
The asana is recommended for disorders of the urinary system. Along
with Kandasana (Plate 47 1 ) and Supta Trivikramasana (Plate 478)
Rajakapotasana is recommended for controlling sexual desire.
1 9 1 . Piidiiizgustha
Dhanura,sana Forty-three* (Plate 555)

Pada means the foot. Ailgustha means the big toe and dhanu a bow.
This is an intensified version of Dhanurasana. (Plate 63)
The body here resembles a taut bow from the shoulders to the

400

knees. The legs from the knees to the toes and the extended arms over
the head resemble the tightly drawn bow-string.
The posture is given below in three movements.
Technique
I . Lie fiat on the floor on the stomach, face downwards.
Put the palms on the floor on either side of the chest. Press them
down and straightening the arms, raise the head and trunk off the
floor as in Bhujangasana I . (Plate 73.) Bend the knees and lift the
feet up. Exhale, move the feet and head closer to each other and try
to touch the head with the feet. (Plate 552)
2.

3· Place one foot over the other. Then, putting greater weight on the
hand on one side, lift the other hand off the floor. With a fast and
deep exhalation stretch the lifted arm from the shoulder over the head
and catch the toes. (Plate 553.) Now lift the other hand off the floor
with an exhalation and also grasp the toes. Maintain a firm grip on the
toes and with the right hand catch the right big toe tightly and hold
the left one with the left hand. (Plate 554.) Take a few breaths.

553
4· Hold the feet firmly, otherwise they will slip from the hands. Then
with an exhalation stretch the arms and the legs as high as you can
above the head. Try to straighten the arms at the elbows. This is the
first movement. (Plate 555.) Hold the pose for about 1 5 seconds.
5· Maintaining the grip on the toes, now bend the elbows and pull the
feet down until the heels rest on the head. Gradually increase the
tension so that the heels rest first on the forehead, then on the eyes

and lastly on the lips. (Plate 556.) This is the second movement. Stay
in the pose for a few seconds.
6. Still maintaining a firm grip on the toes, lower the feet until they
touch the sides of the shoulders. (Plate 557.) This is the third move­
ment. Stay in it for a few seconds.
7· After completing the third movement, exhale and stretch the legs and

402

arms up. Release the legs one by one, putting the hands down immedi­
ately on the floor, otherwise due to the recoil of the spine, one is likely
to bang the face. Then rest on the floor and relax.
8. Due to the stretch of the neck, shoulders, chest and spine as well
as the pressure of the abdomen against the floor, the breathing will be
very fast and laboured. Try to breathe normally during all three
movements.
Effects
In this asana, all the vertebrae benefit from the stretch. The entire
body bears the strain and becomes more elastic. The whole weight falls
on the abdominal area near the navel and due to the pressure on the

Yoga.sanas, Bandha and Kriya.

403

abdominal aorta, blood circulates properly round the abdominal organs.
This keeps them healthy and improves the digestion. In this posture
the shoulder-blades are well stretched so that stiffness in the shoulders
is relieved. The most noticeable effect, however, is that throughout
the strenuous movements, the mind remains passive and still. This
asana helps to keep one trim and young in body, and fresh and alert
in mind.

Place the right foot at the root of the left thigh and then lie fiat on
the back.
2. Now roll over on the stomach without disturbing the position of
the right foot. Exhale, and moving the right arm from the shoulder
behind the back, catch the right big toe with the right hand. The right
arm and leg are now in Baddha Padmasana. (Plate I I 8.) Take a few
breaths and lift the head and chest off the floor.
3· Exhale, bend the left knee and catch the left big toe with the left

hand. Rotate the left arm and shoulder and without releasing the grip
on the toe lift the left arm and leg up until they are in Padailgustha

9· Repeat the pose on the other side for the same length of time. The
left arm and leg will now be in Baddha Padmasana, while the right
arm and leg will be in Padangu��ha Dhanurasana. Follow the technique
stated above, reading left for right and vice versa.
Effects
All the vertebrae benefit from the intense stretch and the whole body
becomes more supple. The abdominal area near the navel bears the
weight of the body and, due to the pressure on the abdominal aorta,
blood circulates properly in that region thus keeping the abdominal
organs healthy. This improves the digestion. The shoulder-blades are
fully extended so that stiffness in the shoulder joints is relieved.
The pose makes the knees firm and relieves pain in the knee joints
due to rheumatism or gout. The pressure of the hands on the feet
corrects the arches and helps to cure fiat feet. The pose strengthens
the ankle joints, relieves pain in the heels and helps persons suffering
from calcaneal spurs.
194. Kapinjaliisana Forty-three* (Plate 567)
Kapinjala is a kind of partridge, the Chataka bird which is supposed
to live only on raindrops and dew.
The pose is a combination of Vasisthanasana (Plate 398) and
Padangu��ha Dhanurasana (Plate 555) and is a difficult one to master.
Technique
1 . Stand in Ta�asana. (Plate 1 . ) Bend forward, rest the palms on the
floor and move the legs back about 4 to 5 feet as if performing Adho
Mukha Svanasana. (Plate 75)
2. Turn the whole body sideways to the right and balance it on the
right palm and foot. The outer side of the right foot should rest firmly
on the ground.
3· Place the left foot over the right foot, rest the left palm on the left

of the body is in Vasi��hasana.
4· Exhale, bend the left leg at the knees and catch the left big toe
firmly between the thumb and the index and middle fingers of the left
hand.
5· Rotate the left elbow and shoulder and stretch the left arm and leg
behind the back to form a bow, without releasing the grip on the left
big toe. (Plate 567.) The left arm and leg are now in Padangu��ha
D hanurasana.

6. Balance for a few seconds, keeping the right arm and leg rigid and
also maintaining the grip of the left hand on the left big toe. As the
spine, chest, neck and shoulders are fully stretched and the abdomen
is contracted, breathing will be laboured.
7· Release the grip on the left big toe, straighten the left leg and place
the left foot over the right foot and the left hand on the left hip. Rest
both palms and feet on the floor as in position I above. Then repeat
the pose on the other side for the same length of time. The left side
of the body will now be in Vasi��hasana (Plate 398) while the right
side will be in Padailgu��ha Dhanurasana. (Plate 555.) Follow the tech­
nique given above, reading left for right and vice versa.
Effects
In this posture the wrists are strengthened and the shoulder-blades
fully exercised so that stiffness in the shoulder joints is relieved. The
legs are toned and all the vertebrae benefit. The chest expands fully
and the abdominal muscles become powerful. The asana helps to keep
the whole body in good condition .

lower the thighs (Plate 568) and feet until the toes touch the back of
the head. (Plate 569.) Without moving the elbows, lift the wrists slightly
off the ground and catch the big toes with the hands without loosening
the finger grip. (Plate 570.) Push the chest forward and stay in the
pose as long as you can, for a few seconds.

568
3· In other back-bending postures, one is able to get some help to
stretch the spine. Here, however, the spine has to move independently
in order to get the requisite curvature.
4· As the spine, chest, shoulders and neck are fully stretched, and the
abdomen is contracted, it is difficult to breathe normally. Return to
�frsasana I (Plate 190), slide the legs to the floor and relax or do
Urdhva Dhanurasana (Plate 486) and stand up in Ta<;iasana (Plate 1),
or follow on with Vipar1ta Chakrasana. (Plates 488 to 499)

Effects
In addition to the effects of Sirsasana I (Plate 190), all the vertebrae
are exercised in this asana. As the blood supply to the spine is
increased, the nerves do not degenerate. The abdominal organs are also
toned by the stretch.
196. GarJcf.a BherurJcf.Zisana Fifty-six* (Plates 580 and 581)
Ga�<:ia means the cheek, the whole side of the face including the
temple. Bherunda means terrible, formidable; it is also a species of
bird. This difficult back-bending posture is given below in two stages.
Technique
I . Fold a blanket on the floor and lie on it full length on the stomach,
face down with the hands stretched back. Stretch the neck and rest the
chin firmly on the blanket, otherwise it will scrape on the floor.
2. Bend the elbows, place the hands by the chest, fingers pointing in
the direction of the head. Bend the knees and move the feet towards
the chest, which will be lifted slightly off the floor. (Plate 571)
3· Exhale, press the palms to the floor, kick the legs and stretch them
straight. (Plate 572.) The chin, neck, arms and upper ribs are the only
parts of the body touching the blanket on the floor.

knees (Plate 573), and lower the feet till they rest on the head. (Plate
574.) Take a few breaths.
5· Exhale, lower the legs still further and bring the feet in front of
the head. (Plate 575)
6. Take the palms off the floor, widen the arms from the shoulders,
bring them one by one in front of the head and clasp the feet with the
hands. (Plates 576 and 577.) Take two breaths.

7. Exhale, pull the feet to the floor on each side of the face near the
temples and cheeks. (Plates 578.) The heels should touch the shoulders.
Now press the toes down with the wrists and forearms. (Plate 579)

578
8. Interlock the fingers and place the palms on the floor by pressing
the upper part of the feet with the wrists. (Plate 580.) This is the first
stage.
9· Stay in the pose for a few seconds. Due to the intense stretch of
the spine and contraction of the abdomen, breathing will be very fast
and laboured. Do not hold the breath.
10. Extend the arms straight sideways like the wings of a gliding bird
and balance for a few seconds. (Plate 581.) This is the second stage
which is more difficult than the first one.

I 1 . Place the palms on t�e floor, roll the body over the chin (Plates
582 and 583), move into Urdhva Dhanurasana (Plate 486) and stand
up in Ta�asana (Plate I) and relax or practise Viparlta Chakrasana.
(Plates 488 to 499)

Effects
Apart from toning the entire spine and abdominal organs, the asana
stimulates the nerve centres in Miiladhara Chakra (the pelvic plexus),
Svadhighana Chakra (the hypo-gastric plexus) and Visuddhi Chakra
(the pharyngeal plexus) and the glands situated there. Due to the copious
supply of blood to these glands, their functioning improves and this
leads to increased vitality.
I97· Vipar"ita Salabhasana Fifty-eight* (Plate 584)
Viparlta means reverse, opposite or inverted. Salabha is a locust. The

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

417

aretch in this pose is more intense than in Ga��a Bheru��asana (Plates
580 and 5 8 1 ) and the movements are converse to those in Halasana.
(Plate 241)
Technique
r. Fold a blanket on the floor and lie on it full length on the stomach,
face down. Stretch the neck and rest the chin firmly on the blanket,
otherwise it will scrape.
2. Bend the elbows and place the palms by the chest, fingers pointing

to the head.

3· Exhale, bend, lift the knees and move the feet towards the chest,
which will be lifted slightly off the floor. (Plate 571)
4· Take a few breaths and then with an exhalation, kick the legs up in
the air, stretch the body up and balance (Plate 572), taking the weight
of the body on the chin, neck, shoulders, elbows and wrists. Try to
breathe normally.
5· Exhale, bend the knees (Plate 573), lower the legs and move the
feet over and beyond the head until the toes rest on the floor. (Plate
582.) Stretch the feet as far as you can from the head and try to
straighten the legs as much as possible. Stretch the arms back, palms
down. (Plate 584)

6. Stay for a few seconds in the asana, which now appears to be the
converse pose of Halasana. (Plate 241.) Due to the intense stretch of
the spine and pressure on the abdomen, breathing will be very fast
and laboured, so do not hold the breath.
7· Bend the elbows and widen the arms. Bring the hands near the
shoulders and place the palms on the floor. Bend the knees, bring the
feet closer to the head (Plate 582), roll the body over the chin (Plate
583) and perform Urdhva Dhanurasana. (Plate 486.) Stand up in

4I8

Ta�asana (Plate I ) or with an exhalation do Vipar'ita Chakrasana
(Plates 488 to 499) and relax.
Effects

asana. (Plates 5 8o and 58 I.) The purpose of these two asanas is to
awaken Ku��alin'i the Divine Cosmic Energy in our bodies, symbolised
by a coiled and sleeping serpent lying dormant in the lowest nerve
centre at the base of the spine. The Yogi makes a conscious effort to
arouse this latent Energy and lead it up the spine to the brain (the
Sahasrara or thousand-petalled lotus in the upper cerebral centre) and
then he submerges his ego by concentrating upon the Divine Source
of all energy in order to be released from worldly bondage. 'As rivers
flow into the sea and so lose name and form, even so the wise man,
freed from name and form, attains the Supreme Being, the Self­
Luminous, the Infin ite.'
.

I98. Tiriang Mukhottanosana Sixty* (Plate 586)
Tiriang means oblique, transverse, horizontal, reverse or upside down.
Mukha means the face and also chief, principal or prominent. Uttana
is a deliberate or an intense stretch. In this back-bending posture the
head is upside down with an intense stretch on arms, legs and the
entire trunk.
Technique
1 . Stand in Ta�asana. (Plate 1.) Spread the legs a foot apart and rest
the palms on the hips.
2. Push the pelvic region slightly forward (Plate 483), exhale and curve
the trunk back so that the weight of the body is felt on the thighs
and feet. (Plate 484)
3· Raise the arms above the head and drop the hands to the floor. (Plate
485.) Immediately straighten the arms at the elbows and rest the
palms on the floor. This is now Urdhva Dhanurasana. (Plate 486)
4· Without moving the heels, widen the distance between the toes, so
that the feet will be at an angle instead of parallel to each other.
5 · Exhale, stretch the trunk as high as you can above the floor and
bring the hands closer and closer to the feet. Stretch the head and
neck as far back as possible and touch the feet with the hands. (Plate
585.) Take a few breaths which will be fast and laboured due to the
intense stretch of the abdomen, chest and back.

6. With a deep exhalation, lift the hands off the floor one by one and
catch the shins just above the ankles. (Plate 586.) Move the toes in
and balance. This is the final position. After holding it for a few
seconds according to capacity, put the hands one by one on the floor,
go back to Ordhva Dhanurasana (Plate 486) and then to Tac;Iasana.
(Plate r.) After mastering the technique, one c�n release the hands and
stand up in Tadasana without going back to Urdhva Dhanurasana.

Effects

586

This difficult pose strengthens the legs and tones and vitalises the spine
and abdominal organs. The chest and shoulder joints are fully stretched
while the pelvic region receives an ample supply of blood and becomes
healthier.
199. Natarajasana Fifty-eight* (Plates 590, 591 and 591a)
Nataraja (nata = dancer; raja= lord, king) is a name of Siva, Lord
of the Dance: Siva is not only the god of mystical stillness, death and
destruction, but also Lord of the Dance. In His Himalayan abode on
�ount Kailasa and in His southern home, the temple of Chidambaram,
Siva dances. The God created over a hundred dances, some calm and
gentle, others fierce and terrible. The most famous of the terrible ones

420

Light on Yoga

is the Tal)9ava, the cosmic dance of destruction, in which Siva, full of
fury at his father-in-law Dak�a for killing his beloved spouse Sat'i,
surrounded by his attendants (ganas), beats out a wild rhythm, destroys
Dak�a and threatens the world. S iva, as Lord of the Dance, has inspired
some of the finest Indian sculptures and South Indian bronzes.
This vigorous and beautiful pose is dedicated to Siva, Lord of the
Dance, who is also the fountain and source of Yoga.
Technique
r. Stand in Ta�asana. (Plate r.) Stretch the left arm out in front keep­
ing it parallel to the floor.
Bend the right knee and lift up the right foot. Hold the right big
toe between the thumb and the index and middle fingers of the right
hand. Bend the lifted right knee and draw the leg up and back. (Plate
587)
2.

3· Roll the fingers and thumb of the right hand round the right big
toe. Simultaneously rotate the right elbow and shoulder and stretch
the right arm up behind the head, without releasing the grip on the
big toe. (Plate 588.) Again pull the right arm and leg up so that they
form a bow behind the back. (Plate 589.) The right thigh will be
parallel to the floor and the right shin perpendicular to it. (Plates 590
and 591)
Bring the left arm straight in front level with the shoulder, keeping
the fingers pointing forward.

pendicular to the floor.
6. Balance firmly from ro to 1 5 seconds with deep and even breathing.
7. Release the grip on the right foot, lower both arms and stand
again in Tadasana. (Plate r.) Repeat the pose for the same length of
time on the other side. This time, balance on the right leg, catch the
left big toe behind the back with the left hand and stretch the right
arm straight out in front.

8. Advanced pupils may hold the foot with both hands, rest it on the
head and balance. (Plate 591a)

591a
Effects
This difficult balancing asana develops poise and a graceful carriage.
It tones and strengthens the leg muscles. The shoulder-blades get full
movement and the chest expands fully. All the vertebral joints benefit
from the exercise in this pose.
200. Saviisana (Also called Mrtasana) (Plate 592)
Sava or Mrta means a corpse. In this asana the object is to imitate a
corpse. Once life has departed, the body remains still and no move­
ments are possible. By remaining motionless for some time and keeping
the mind still while you are fully conscious, you learn to relax. This
conscious relaxation invigorates and refreshes both body and mind. But
it is much harder to keep the mind than the body still. Therefore, this
apparently easy posture is one of the most difficult to master.
Technique
I . Lie fiat on the back full length like a corpse. Keep the hands a
little away from the thighs, with the palms up.

Close the eyes. If possible place a black cloth folded four times over
the eyes. Keep the heels together and the toes apart.

3· To start with breathe deeply. Later the breathing should be fine and
slow, with no jerky movements to disturb the spine or the body.
4· Concentrate on deep and fine exhalations, in which the nostrils do
not feel the warmth of breath.
5. The lower jaw should hang loose and not be clenched. The tongue
should not be disturbed, and even the pupils of the eyes should be kept
completely passive.
6. Relax completely and breathe out slowly.
7. If the mind wanders, pause without any strain after each slow

e,xhalation.

8. Stay in the pose from I 5 to 20 minutes.
9· One is apt to fall asleep in the beginning. Gradually, when the

nerves become passive, one feels completely relaxed and refreshed.
In good relaxation one feels energy flow from the back of the head
towards the heels and not the other way round. One also feels as if the
body is elongated.
Effects

Verse 32 of the First Chapter of the Ha?ha Yoga Prad"ipika states :
'Lying upon one's back on the ground at full length like a corpse is
called Savasana. This removes the fatigue caused by the other asanas
and induces calmness of mind.'
Mrtasana is thus described in verse I r of the Second Chapter of the
Gherar:cfa Samhita: 'Lying fiat on the ground (on one's back) like a
corpse is called Mrtasana. This posture destroys fatigue, and quiets the
agitation of the mind.'
'The mind is the lord of the Indriyas (the organs of senses ) ; the
Pral!a (the Breath of Life) is the lord of the mind.' 'When the mind
is absorbed it is called Mok�a (final emancipation, liberation of the
'

424

Light on Yoga

soul); when Pr�a and Manas (the mind) have been absorbed, an un­
definable joy ensues.' Verses 29 and 30, chapter IV, Harha Yoga
Pradipika.
To tame Pr�a depends upon the nerves. Steady, smooth, fine and
deep breathing without any jerky movements of the body soothes the
nerves and calms the mind. The stresses of modern civilisation are a
strain on the nerves for which Savasana is the best antidote.

•

U��'iyana means flying up. Strictly speaking it is not an asana, but
a bandha, that is a restraint. As condensers, fuses and switches con­
trol the flow of electricity, so bandhas regulate the flow of pr�a
(energy). In this b?.ndha the prana or energy is made to move from
the lower abdomen towaras the head. For a detailed discussion on
bandha and prana, see Part Three on Pranayama.

Technique
1.

Stand in Ta<;iasana. (Plate I )

2. Spread the legs a foot apart.
3· Stoop slightly forward, bending the knees slightly and place the

hands with the fingers spread wide on the middle of the thighs.

4. Lower the hands until the chin rests in the notch between the

collar-bones on top of the breast-bone.

5· Inhale deeply and then exhale quickly so that all the air is forced

from the lungs in a rush.

6. Hold the breath (without any inhalation). Pull the whole ab­
dominal region back towards the spine. Contract the abdominal region
and lift it up towards the breast-bone, pressing the hands against the
thighs. (Plate 593)
7. Maintaining the abdominal grip, lift the hands from the thighs and
rest them on the hips.
8. Straighten both legs and the back without loosening the abdominal
grip or raising the chin from the breast-bone. (Plate 594)
9· Relax the abdominal muscles but without moving the chin and
head. If the latter move, strain is at once felt in the region of the heart.
IO. Inhaie slowly and deeply.
I 1. Throughout positions 6 to 9 above, do not inhale. Do not hold
the pose for more than 5 to I O seconds depending on your endurance.

12. Take a few breaths, then repeat the cycle stated in paras I to r o
above. Do not, however, repeat i t more than six to eight times at a
stretch in 24 hours. Only increase the duration of the pose or the num­
ber of cycles under the personal supervision of an experienced Guru.
13. The cycles should be done only once a day at a stretch.
14. Practise on an empty stomach after evacuating both the bladder
and bowels.
1 5 . First learn U<;f<;f'iyana Bandha in the standing position, then in the
sitting position as a preliminary step for the practice of Pranayama.
r6. It should be done during exhalation (rechaka) and retention of
breath (kumbhaka) in the various types of Pranayama described in Part
Three.

Effects
I t tones the abdominal organs, increases the gastric fire and eliminates
toxins in the digestive tract.
202. Nauli Sixteen* (Plates 595 and 596)
The word Nauli is not found in standard dictionaries. Ullola meaning

Yogasanas, Bandha and Kriya

427

a large wave or surge, conveys some idea of the process of Nauli
where the abdominal muscles and organs are made to move laterally and
vertically in a surging motion. Nau means a boat and li to cling to, lie
on, hide or cover. The pitching of a boat on a stormy sea conveys some
idea of the process of Nauli.
Nauli is a kriya or process and not an asana. Care should be observed
in its performance, otherwise the process leads to numerous diseases.
It is not, therefore, recommended for the average practitioner. First
master Uddiyana Bandha before attempting Nauli, which is described
in the Gherunda Samhita under the name Lauliki.
Technique
r . Stand in Ta<;Iasana. (Plate I )
2. Spread the legs a foot apart, bend slightly at the knees and stoop
forward.
3· Place the hands with the fingers spread wide on the thighs just
above the knees.
Lower the head until the chin rests in the notch between the
collar-bones on the top of the breast-bone.

4·

Inhale deeply, then exhale quickly so that all the air is forced from
the lungs in a rush.
5·

6. Hold the breath (without any inhalation). Pull the whole ab­
dominal region back towards the spine.
7· The area between the pelvic rim and the floating ribs on both sides
of the abdomen should be made passive to create hollowness there.
At the same time push tJ:le abdominal recti forward. (Plate 595 front
view ; and Plate 596 side view)
8. Maintain this position from 5 to IO seconds, according to your
capacity.
9· Relax the grip on the recti and go back to the position described
in para. 6 above.
IO. Relax the abdomen and inhale slowly.
I r . Take a few deep breaths. Repeat the cycle in paras I to I o above,
six to eight times at a stretch only once every 24 hours.

12. Practise Nauli on an empty stomach after evacuating the bladder
and bowels.

Hints and Cautions

Read and digest thoroughly the following hints and cautions before
attempting the pdinayama techniques mentioned later.
•

Qualifications for fitness
r. Just as post-graduate trammg depends upon the ability and
discipline acquired in mastering the subject in which one graduated,
so pra�ayama training demands mastery of asanas and the strength
and discipline arising therefrom.
2. The fitness of the aspirant for training and advancement in
Pra�ayama is to be gauged by an experienced Guru or teacher and his
personal supervision is essential.

3· Pneumatic tools can cut through the hardest rock. In Pr�ayama
the yogi uses his lungs as pneumatic tools. If they are not used properly,
they destroy both the tool and the person using it. The same is true
of pr�ayama.
Cleanliness and Food
4· One does not enter a temple with a dirty body or mind. Before
entering the temple of his own body, the yogi observes the rules of
cleanliness.
5· Before starting pra�ayama practices the bowels should be evacuated
and the bladder emptied. This leads to comfort in the bandhas.
6. Preferably pra�ayama should be practised on an empty stomach,
but if this is difficult, a cup of milk, tea, coffee or cocoa may be taken.
Allow at least six hours to elapse after a meal before practising
- - pra�ayama.
7. Light food may be taken half an hour after finishing pra�ayama
practices.
Time and Place
8. The best time for practice is in the early morning (preferably before
sunrise) and after sunset. According to the Ha?�a Yoga Pradipika,
pra�ayama should be practised four times a day, in the early morning,

432

Light on Yoga

noon, evening and midnight, with 8o cycles at a time (chapter I I , verse
I I). This is hardly possible in the fast modern age. What is therefore
recommended is to practise at least I S minutes a day, but the 8o cycles
are for intensely devoted practitioners, and not for the average
householder.
9· The best seasons in which to start the practice are spring and autumn
when the climate is equable.
I o. Pr3..I).ayama should be done in a clean airy place, free from insects.
Since noise creates restlessness practise during quiet hours.
I I . Pranayama should be practised with determination and regularity
at the same time and place and in the same posture. Variation is per­
practised, that is to say, if
missible only in the type of pranayama
.
Siirya Bhedana Prar:tayama is done one day, Sitali may be done the
next day and Bhastrika be done on the third day. Nadi Shodhana
Prar:tayama, however, should be practised daily.
.

•

Posture
I 2. Breathing in pranayama practices is done through the nose only,
except in Sitall and Sitakari.
I3. Pra�ayama is best done sitting on the floor on a folded blanket.
The postures suitable are Siddhasana, Virasana, Padmasana and
Baddhakoy;tasana. Any other sitting posture may be taken provided the
back is kept absolutely erect from the base of the spine to the neck
and perpendicular to the floor. Some types, however, may be done in a
reclining position as detailed later.
14 . During practice no strain should be felt in the facial muscles, eyes
and ears, or in the neck muscles, shoulders, arms, thighs and feet. The
thighs and arms should be relaxed deliberately since they are un­
consciously tensed during pranayama.
I 5· Keep the tongue passive or saliva will accumulate in the mouth.
If it does, swallow it before exhalation (rechaka) and not while holding
the breath (kumbhaka).
During inhalation and retention the rib cage should expand both
forwards and sideways, but the area below the shoulder-blades and
armpits should only expand forwards.
I 6.

17. To start with there will be perspiration and trembling which will
disappear in course of time.
18. In all the pray;tayama practices done in a sitting posture, the head
should hang down from the nape of the neck, the chin resting in the

Pra7Jayama

433

notch between the collar-bones on the top of the breast-bone. This
chinlock or Jalandhara Bandha should be used except where specifically
stated in the techniques hereafter given.
Keep the eyes closed throughout as otherwise the mind will wander
after outside objects and be distracted. The eyes, if kept open, will feel
a burning sensation, and irritability.
r 9·

20. No pressure should be felt inside the ear during the practice of
pranayama.
-

2 1 . The left arm is kept straight, the back of the wrist resting on the
left knee. The forefinger is bent towards the thumb, its tip touching
the tip of the thumb. This is the JiHina Mudra described later in the
technique.
22. The right arm is bent at the elbow and the hand is kept on the
nose to regulate the even flow of breath and to gauge its subtlety. This
is felt through the tips of the ring and little fingers which control the
left nostril and through the tip of the thumb which controls the right
nostril. Details of the right hand position are discussed in the technique.
In some methods of prfu;layama both the hands rest on the knees in the
Jiiana Mudra.
23. When a baby learns to walk by itself, the mother remains passive
bodily, but alert mentally. In an emergency, as when the child
stumbles, her body springs into action to save it from a fall. So also,
in the practice of pral)ayama the brain is kept passive but alert. When­
ever the organs of the body fail to work properly, the watchful brain
sends messages of warning. The ear is told to listen for the proper
sound of the breath (which is described below). The hand and nose
are told to observe the sensitivity of the breath flowing through the
nasal passages.
24. It may be asked that if the brain is required to send warnings to
the senses, how can one concentrate on pral)ayama? A painter
absorbed in his work notes various details like perspective and com­
position, the colour tones and shades, the foreground and background
and the strokes of the paint-brush all at once. A musician playing a
melody watches his finger movements and sound patterns, the tuning
of the instrument and its pitch. Though the artist and the musician
are both observing and correcting the details, they are concentrating
on their work. So also the yogi observes details like time, posture and
an even breath rhythm, and is alert and sensitive to the flow of pral)a
within him.

434

Light on Yoga

2 5. As a careful mother teaches her child to walk carefree, so the care­
ful mind of the yogi teaches the senses to be carefree. By continued
practice of pra�ayama the senses become free of obsession for the
things they once pined for.
26. Each should measure his own capacity when doing pranayama and
not exceed it. This may be gauged as follows : suppose one can with
comfort inhale and exhale for 10 seconds each in rhythmic cycles for a
given length of time, say 5 minutes. If there is any change in the
rhythm in which the period of inhalation or of exhalation decreases, to
say 7 or 8 seconds, one has reached one's capacity. To go beyond. this
point, strains the lungs unduly and brings in its wake a host of respira­
tory diseases.
•

27. Faulty practice puts undue stress on the lungs and diaphragm. The
respiratory system suffers and the nervous system is adversely affected.
The very foundation of a healthy body and a sound mind is shaken by
faulty practice of pra�ayama. Forceful and strained inhalation or exhala­
tion is wrong, except in Bhastrika Pra�ayama.
28. Evenness of breathing leads to healthy nerves and so to evenness of
mind and temper.
29. Asanas should never be practised immediately after pra�ayama. If
pr�ayama is done first, allow an hour to elapse before starting asanas,
for the nerves which are soothed in pr�ayama are liable to be ruffled
by the bodily movement of the asanas.
Pra�ayama, however, may be done not less than 1 5 minutes after
mild practice of asanas.
30.

31. Strenuous asanas cause fatigue. When exhausted do not practise
pr�ayama in any sitting posture, as the back cannot stay erect, the body
trembles and the mind becomes disturbed. Deep breathing as in Ujjayi
done in a reclining position relieves fatigue.
32. When deep, steady and long breathing cannot be maintained
rhythmically, stop. Do not proceed further. The rhythm should be
gauged from the nasal sound produced in inhalation ('ssssssa' which
sounds like a leak in a cycle tube) and exhalation (the aspirate
'huuuuuuuuum' sound). If the volume of the sound is reduced, stop.

Try to achieve an even ratio in inhalation (puraka) and exhalation
(rechaka). For example, if one is for 5 seconds during a given continuous
cycle, the other should be for the same time.
33·

34· The Ujjayi and Na<;li Sodhana types of pra�ayama are the most

PriiYJayiima

435

beneficial ones which can be practised by pregnant women, preferably
in Baddhakonasana. During pregnancy, however, the breath should
never be held without the guidance of an experienced teacher.
35· After completing any pranayama practice always lie down on the
back like a corpse in Savasana (Plate 592) for at least 5 or 1 0 minutes
in silence. The mind should be completely switched off and every limb
and sense organ completely passive as if dead. Savasana after pra�ayama
refreshes both the body and the mind.
Kumbhakas
36. All the three Bandhas, namely Jalandhara, U��Iyana and Mula,
should be observed in kumbhaka (retention of breath after full inhalation
or restraint following complete exhalation) as mentioned later. The
bandhas are like safety-valves which should be kept shut during the
practice of kumbhakas.
37. Thorough mastery of inhalation (puraka) and exhalation (rechaka)
is essential before any attempt is made to learn antara kumbhaka (reten­
tion following inhalation).
38. Bahya kumbhaka (restraint following exhalation) should not be tried
until antara kumbhaka has become natural.
39· During the practice of kumbhaka there is a tendency to draw in air
as well as to tighten and loosen the diaphragm and abdominal organs
for the sake of increasing the period of retention. This is unconscious
and unintentional. Care should be taken to avoid it.
40. If it is found difficult to hold the breath (khumbaka) after each
inhalation or exhalation, do some cycles of deep breathing and then
practise kumbhakas. For instance, 3 cycles of deep breathing may be
followed by one cycle of kumbhaka. Then there should be another 3
cycles of deep breathing followed by a second cycle of kumbhaka, and
so on.
41. I f the rhythm of inhalation or exhalation is disturbed by holding
the breath, lessen the duration of kumbhaka.

42. Persons suffering from eye or ear trouble (like glaucoma and pus in
the ear) should not attempt to hold the breath.
43· Sometimes constipation occurs in the initial stages following upon
the introduction of kumbhaka. This is temporary and will disappear in
due course.
44· The normal rate of breaths per minute is 1 5· This rate increases

436

Light on Yoga

when the body is upset by indigestion, fever, cold and cough, or by
emotions like fear, anger or lust. The normal rate of breathing is 21 ,6oo
breaths inhaled and exhaled every 24 hours. The yogi measures his span
of life not by the number of days, but of breaths. Since breathing is
lengthened in praJ;layama, its practice leads to longevity.
45· Continuous practice of praJ;layama will change the mental outlook
of the practitioner and reduce considerably the craving of his senses for
worldly pleasures like smoking, drinking and sexual indulgence.
46. I n the practice of praJ;layama the senses are drawn inwards and in
the silence of the kumbhaka the aspirant hears his inner voice calling :
'Look within ! The source of all happiness is within !' This also prepares
him for the next stage of yoga, pratyahara, which leads to freedom from
the domination and tyranny of the senses.
47. Since the eyes are kept closed throughout the practice of praJ;layama,
the passage of time is noted by the mental repetition (japa) of a sacred
word or name. This repetition of the sacred words or names is the seed
(bi'ja) planted in the yogi's mind. This seed grows and makes him fit for
dhyanaor concentration, the sixth stage of Yoga. Ultimately it produces
the fruit of samadhi, where there is experience of full consciousness and
supreme joy, where the yogi merges with the Maker of the Universe
and feels what he can never express-yet cannot entirely conceal. Words
fail to convey the experience adequately, for the mind cannot find words
with which to describe it. It is a feeling of that peace which passeth all
understanding.
B A N D H A S , NA D I S AND C H A KRAS

In order to follow the techniques of praJ;layama it is necessary to know
something about bandhas, na�is and chakras.
Bandha means bondage, joining together, fettering or catching hold
of. It is also a posture in which certain organs or parts of the body are
contracted and controlled.
Na�i is a tubular channel in the body through which energy flows.
Chakras are wheels or circles. Those in the body are the fly-wheels in
the body machinery.
When electricity is generated, it is necessary to have transformers,
conductors, fuses, switches and insulated wires to carry the power to its
destination, as without these the electricity generated would be lethal.
When praJ;la is made to ftow in the yogi's body by the practice of
praJ;layama it is equally necessary for him to employ bandhas to prevent
the dissipation of energy and to carry it to the right quarters without
causing damage elsewhere. Without the bandhas, praJ;la is lethal.

PratJa.yama

437

The three main bandhas, which are important for pr3J?.3yama,
are: ( r ) Jalandhara Bandha, (2) U��Hyana Bandha and (3) MUla
Bandha.
The first one which the yogi should master is Jalandhara. }ala means
a net, a web, a lattice or a mesh. In Jalandhara the neck and throat are
contracted and the chin is made to rest on the chest in the notch between
the collar-bones and at the top of the breast-bone. It is mastered while
doing Sarvangasana (see pp. 205-20) and its cycles, for here also the
chin is pressed against the sternum. The Jalandhara Bandha regulates
the flow of blood and pra�a to the heart, the glands in the neck and
the head together with the brain. If pra�ayama is performed without
Jalandhara Bandha pressure is immediately felt on the heart, behind the
eyeballs and in the ear cavity and the head feels dizzy. Jalandhara
Bandha is essential in the three processes of pr3J;t3yama, namely, puraka
(inhalation), rechaka (exhalation) and kumbhaka (retention).
U��lyana means flying up. The process in U��yana Bandha is to lift
the diaphragm high up the thorax and to pull in the abdominal organs
against the back towards the spine. It is said that through U��iyana
Bandha, the great bird pra�a is forced to fly up through the su�um�a
nac;Ii, the main channel for the flow of nervous energy, which is situated
inside the meru-danc;Ia or the spinal column. It is said that U��fyana is
the best of bandhas and he who constantly practises it as taught by his
Guru or master becomes young again. It is said to be the lion that kills
the elephant named Death. It should be performed only during· bahya
kumbhaka following rechaka, that is, during the interval between com­
plete exhalation and fresh inhalation when breathing is suspended. It
exercises the diaphragm and abdominal organs. The cavity created by
the lift of the diaphragm gives a gentle massage to the muscles of the
heart, thereby toning it. U�c;lfyana Bandha should never be attempted
during antara kumbhaka, that is the interval between complete inhala­
tion and the start of exhalation when breath is retained, otherwise it will
strain the heart and diaphragm and the eyes will puff out.
Mula means root, source, origin or cause, basis or foundation. Mula
Bandha is the region between the anus and the scrotum. By contracting
this region, Apana Vayu (the pra�a in the lower abdomen), whose course
is downwards, is made to flow up to unite with the Pra�a Vayu, which
has its seat in the region of the chest.
Miila Bandha should be attempted first in antara kumbhaka (retention
after inhalation). The region of the lower abdomen between the navel
and the anus is contracted towards the spine and pulled up towards the
diaphragm. In Uc;ic;Ifyana Bandha the entire region from the anus to the
diaphragm up to the sternum is pulled back towards the spine and lifted
up. But in Miila Bandha the whole lower abdominal area between the

438

Light on Yoga

anus and the navel is contracted, pulled back to the spine and lifted up
towards the diaphragm.
The practice of contracting the anal sphincter muscles (the Asvini
Mudra) helps one to master Miila Bandha. Asva means a horse. This
mudra (a sealing posture) is so called because it suggests the staling of a
horse. It should be learnt while doing various asanas, especially Tadasana,
Sirsasana,
Sarvangasana, Urdhva Dhanurasana, Ustrasana
and Paschi.
.
mottanasana.
It is said that by the practice of these bandhas the sixteen adharas
are closed. Adhara (from the root ('dhr' =to support) means a support, a
vital part. The sixteen vital parts are: the thumbs, ankles, knees, thighs,
prepuce, organs of generation, navel, heart, neck, throat, palate, nose,
the middle of the eyebrows, forehead, head and Brahmarandhra (the
aperture in the crown of the head through which the soul is said to
escape on leaving the body).
There is a grave danger in attempting to learn the UC;iC;liyana and Miila
Bandhas by oneself, without the personal supervision of an experienced
Guru or teacher. Improper performance of the U��lyana Bandha will
cause involuntary discharge of semen and loss of vitality, while that of
Miila Bandha will seriously weaken the practitioner who will lack
virility. Even the correct performance of Miila Bandha has its own
dangers. It increases sexual retentive power, thereby tempting the
practitioner to abuse that power. If he succumbs to that temptation, he
is lost. All his dormant desires are aroused and become lethal like a sleep­
ing serpent struck with a stick. With the mastery of the three bandhas,
the yogi is at the r:ross-roads of his destiny. One road leads to bhoga or
the enjoyment of worldly pleasures ; the other leads to Yoga or union
with the Supreme Soul. The attraction of worldly pleasures is great.
The yogi, however, feels greater attraction for their Creator. The senses
open outwards and consequently they are attracted to objects and follow
the path of bhoga. If the direction of the senses is changed so that they
turn inwards, then they follow the path of Yoga. The yogi's senses
invert to meet the Creator, the source of all creation. It is when the
aspirant has mastered the three bandhas that the guidance of a Guru is
most essential, for under proper guidance this increased power is subli­
mated for higher and nobler pursuits. The practitioner then becomes an
iirdhvaretus (iirdhva = upwards; retus = semen) or one who lives a life of
celibacy and does not dissipate his virility. He will then acquire moral
and spiritual power. The power within him will shine forth like the sun.
While practising Miila Bandha, the yogi attempts to reach the tru�
source or miila of all creation. His goal is the complete restraint or
bandha of the chitta which includes the mind (manas), the intellect
(buddhi) and the ego (aharhkara).

The human body is a miniature universe in itself. Hatha is composed
of the syllables ha and ��a which mean the sun and the moon respectively. The solar and the lunar energy is said to flow through the two
main na�is, Piilgala and I�a, which start from the right and the left
nostrils respectively and move down to the base of the spine. Piilgala is
the nadi
. is the nadi
. of the moon. In between
. of the sun, while the Ida

. of fire. As stated earlier, Susumna
.
. Nadi
.
is the main channel for the flow of nervous energy, and it is situated
inside the meru-da��a or spinal column. Piilgala and I�a intersect each
other and also Su�umt:la at various places. These junctions are called
chakras or wheels and regulate the body mechanism as fly-wheels
regulate an engine.
The main chakras are: MUladhara Chakra which is situated in the
pelvic region above the anus (mUla= root, cause, source : adhara = sup­
port, or vital part) ; Svadhisthiina Chakra above the organs of generation

is the navel (maz:tipiira =navel) ; the Manas and the Siirya Chakras
between the navel and the heart (manas = mind: siirya = sun); Anahata
Chakra in the cardiac region (anahata = !_?.eart) ; Visuddha Chakra in the
pharyngeal region (visuddha = pure) ; Ajiia Chakra between the eye­
brows (ajiia= command) ; the Sahasrara Chakra, which is called the
thousand-petalled lotus, in the cerebral cavity; and Lala�a Chakra which
is at the top of the forehead (laHi�a = forehead).
It may be that these chakras correspond to the endocrine glands,
which supply hormones and other internal secretions to the system. The
Miiladhara and the Svadhi��hana Chakras perhaps correspond to the
gonads (the testicles, penis and prostate in males and the ovaries, uterus
and vagina in females). In between these two chakras is the seat of the
genitals, known as Kamariipa after Kama the god of passion and love.
The abdominal organs like the stomach, spleen, liver and pancreas
perhaps correspond to the Maz:tipiiraka Chakra. The two adrenals may
stand for the Siirya and Manas Chakras. The Anahata Chakra is the
heart and the main blood vessels around it. The Vi�uddha Chakra may
be the thyroid, parathyroid and the thymus. The Ajiia, Sahasrara and
Lalata Chakras may be the brain matter and the pitutiary and pineal
glands.
According to the Tantric texts the object of Pranayama is to arouse
Kundalin1,
the divine cosmic force in our bodies. Kundalin1
is sym. .

bolised as a coiled and sleeping serpent lying dormant in the lowest nerve
centre at the base of the spinal column, the MUladhara Chakra. This
latent energy has to be aroused and made to go up the spinal column
piercing the chakras up to the Sahasrara (the thousand-petalled lotus in
the head, the network of nerves in the brain) and there to unite with

the Supreme Soul. This is perhaps an allegorical way of describing the
tremendous vitality, especially sexual, which is obtained by the practice
of U991yana and MUla Bandhas described above. The arousing of
Kut;t9alin1 and forcing it up is perhaps a symbolic way of describing the
sublimation of sexual energy.

Technique and Effects of
Pral)ayama
203. U;jayz Prii1Jiiyama (Plate 597)
The prefix ud attached to verbs and nouns, means upwards or superiority
in rank. It also means blowing or expanding. It conveys the sense of
pre-eminence and power.
Jaya means conquest, victory, triumph or success. Looked at from
another viewpoint it implies restraint or curbing.
Ujjayi is the process in which the lungs are fully expanded and the
chest puffed out like that of a proud conqueror.
Technique
I . Sit in any comfortable position like Padmasana (Plate 104), Siddh­
asana (Plate 84) or Virasana (Plate 89).
2. Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk. Rest the
chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the breast-bone.
(This is the Jalandhara Bandha.)

3· Stretch the arms out straight and rest the back of the wrists on the
knees. Join the tips of the index fingers to the tips of the thumbs, keeping
the other fingers extended. (This position or gesture of the hand is known
as the Jfiana Mudra, the symbol or seal of knowledge. The index finger
symbolises the individual soul and the thumb the Universal Soul. The
union of the two symbolises knowledge.)
4· Close the eyes and look inwards. (Plate 597)
5· Exhale completely.
6. Now the Ujjayi method of breathing begins.
7 · Take a slow, deep steady breath through both nostrils. The passage
of the incoming air is felt on the roof of the palate and makes a sibilant
sound (sa). This sound should be heard.
8. Fill the lungs up to the brim. Care should be taken not to bloat the
abdomen in the process of inhalation. (Observe this in all the types of
Pranayama.) This filling up is called puraka (inhalation).

442

Light on Yoga

597
9· The entire abdominal area from the pubes up to the breast-bone
should be pulled back towards the spine.
IO. Hold the breath for a second or two. This internal retention is called
antara kumbhaka. Observe Miila Bandha as described on p. 437.
I I . Exhale slowly, deeply and steadily, until the lungs are completely
empty. As you begin to exhale, keep your grip on the abdomen. After
two or three seconds of exhalation, relax the diaphragm gradually and
slowly. While exhaling the passage of the outgoing air should be felt on
the roof of the palate. The brushing of the air on the palate should make
an aspirate sound (ha). This exhalation is called rechaka.
I 2. Wait for a second before drawing a fresh breath. This waiting period
is called bahya kumbhaka.
I3. The process described from para. 7 to para. I 2 completes one cycle
of Ujjayi Pra�ayama.
I4. Repeat the cycles for five to ten minutes keeping the eyes closed
throughout.
I 5 . Lie on the floor in Savasana. (Plate 592)
'

I6. Ujjayi Pra�ayama may be done without the Jalandhara Bandha even
while walking or lying down. This is the only pra�ayama which can be
done at all times of the day and night.

Prar)ayama

443

Effects
This type of pra1;1ayama aerates the lungs, removes phlegm, gives
endurance, soothes the nerves and tones the entire system. Ujjayi with­
out kumbhaka, done in a reclining position, is ideal for persons suffering
from high blood pressure or coronary troubles.
204. Surya Bhedana Pra:l'}ayama (Plate 599)
Surya is the sun. Bhedana is derived from the root bhid meaning to
pierce, to break or pass through.
In Surya Bhedana PraJ?.ayama, the breath is inhaled through the right
nostril. I n other words the pra!la passes through the Piiigala or Siirya
nadl. A kumbhaka is then performed and the breath is then exhaled
through the left nostril which is the path of the Ida nadr.
•

Technique
I . Sit in any comfortable position like Padmasana (Plate 104), Siddh­
asana (Plate 84) or Virasana (Plate 89).

2. Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk. Rest the
chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the breast-bone.
(This is Jalandhara Bandha.)
3· Stretch the left arm. Rest the back of the left wrist on the left knee.

Perform Joana Mudra with the left hand (as stated in stage 3 of the
technique of Ujjayi).
4· Bend the right arm at the elbow. Bend the index and middle fingers
towards the palm, keeping them passive. Bring the ring and little fingers
towards the thumb. (Plate 598)
5· Place the right thumb on the right side of the nose just below the
nasal bone, the ring and little fingers on the left side of the nose just
below the nasal bone, just above the curve of the fatty tissue of the
nostrils above the upper jaw.
6. Press the ring and the little finger to block the left side of the nose
completely.
7. With the right thumb, press the fatty tissue on the right side so as to
make the outer edge of the right nostril parallel to the lower edge of the
cartilage of the septum.
8. The right thumb is bent at the top joint and the tip of the thumb is
placed at a right angle to the septum. (Plate 599)
9· Now inhale slowly and deeply controlling the aperture of the right

444

598

nostril with the tip of the thumb nearer the nail. Fill the lungs to the
brim (puraka).
IO. Then block the right nostril so that both are now blocked.
Hold the breath for about 5 seconds Cantara kumbhaka) while
practising MUla Bandha (see p. 437).
I 1.

I2. Keeping the right nostril completely blocked, open the left nostril
partially and exhale through it slowly and deeply (rechaka).
During the exhalation regulate the rhythmic flow of air from the
left nostril by adjusting pressure with the ring and little fingers, so that
the outer edge of the left nostril is kept parallel to the septum. The
pressure should be exerted from the inner sides of the tips of the fingers
(away from the nails).
I 3·

1 4· This completes one cycle of Siirya Bhedana Pranayama. Continue
with more cycles at a stretch from 5 to IO minutes, according to capacity.
I 5 . All the inhalations in Siirya Bhedana are from the right nostril and
all the exhalations from the left nostril.
16. Throughout the process, the passage of air is felt at the tips of the
fingers and the thumbs and in the nasal membranes where pressure is
applied. The passage of air makes a sound similar to air escaping from
a cycle tube. This sound should be maintained constant throughout by
varying pressure on the nostrils.

Pra:rJayama

445

I7. The eyes, temples, eyebrows and the skin on the forehead should
remain completely passive and show no sign of strain.
I 8. The mind should be absorbed completely in listening to the proper
sound of the passage of air and in maintaining a proper rhythm in
breathing.
I 9· Each inhalation and exhalation should last for the same length of
ttme.
20. The inhalation and the exhalation should not be forced. An even

and slow rhythm should be maintained throughout.

'

2 1 . Lie down in Savasana after completing pra�ayama. (Plate 592)
.

Effects
By reason of the pressure on the nostrils, in this Pra�ayama the l�gs
have to work more than in the case of Ujjayi. In Siirya Bhedana they
are filled more slowly, steadily, and fuller than in Ujjayi. Siirya Bhedana
increases digestive power, soothes and invigorates the nerves, and cleans
the sinuses.
Note. - It often happens that the passages of both the nostrils are not
of the same width, one being bigger than the other. In that case the
pressure of the fingers has to be adjusted. In some cases the right nostril
is completely blocked while the left one is clear. In that case, inhalation
may be done only through the left nostril, while exhalation is done only
through the right nostril. In course of time due to the manipulation of
the fingers the right nostril clears and inhalation through it becomes
possible.
Caution. - Persons suffering from low blood pressure will derive benefit
but those with high blood pressure or heart trouble ·should not hold
their breath after inhalation Cantara kumbhaka) whilst practising this
pra�ayama.

205. Nacfi Sodhana Pra1Jayama
Na<;fi' is a tubular organ of the body like an artery or a vein for the passage
of pra�a or energy. A na<;fi'has three layers like an insulated electric wire.
The innermost layer is called sira, the middle layer damani' and the entire
organ as well as the outer layer is called nadi'.

Sodhana Pra!fayama is the purification of the nerve�. A little obstruction in a water pipe can cut off the supply completely. A little obstruction
in the nerves can cause great discomfort and paralyse a limb or organ.

2. Empty the lungs completely through the right nostril. Control the
aperture of the right nostril with the inner side of the right thumb,
away from the nail.

3· Now inhale slowly, steadily and deeply through the right nostril,
controlling the aperture with the tip of the right thumb near the nail.
Fill the lungs to the brim (puraka). During this inhalation the left nostril
is completely blocked by the ring and little fingers.
4· After full inhalation, block the right nostril completely with the
pressure of the thumb and release the pressure of the ring and little
fingers on the left nostril. Readjust them on the outer edge of the left
nostril and keep it parallel to the septum. Exhale slowly, steadily and
deeply through the left nostril. Empty the lungs completely. The pres­
sure should be exerted from the inner sides of the tips of the ring and
little fingers (away from the nails) (rechaka).
5· After full exhalation through the left nostril, change the pressure on
it by adjusting the fingers. In the changed position, the tips of the ring
and little fingers nearer the nails exert the pressure.
6. Now inhale through the left nostril slowly, steadily and deeply,
filling the lungs to the brim (puraka).
7· After full ini1alation through the left nostril, block it and exhale
through the right nostril, adjusting the pressure of the right thumb on
the right nostril as stated in para. 2 above (rechaka).

(d) Inhale through the left nostril.
(e) Exhale through the right nostril.
(f) Inhale through the right nostril.
(g) Exhale through the left nostril.
(h) Inhale through the left nostril.
(i) Exhale through the right nostril.
(j) Inhale through the right nostril . . . and so on.
.
Stage (a) above is the preparatory one. The first real Nadl Sodhana
Pranayama cycle starts at stage (b) and ends at stage (e). The second

cycle starts at stage (f) and ends at stage (i). Stage (j) is the safety
measure to be observed after the completion of the cycles in order to
prevent gasping, breathlessness and strain on the heart.
9· Do 8 to IO cycles at a stretch as described above. This may take 6 or
8 minutes.
IO. Inhalation and exhalation from each side should take the same time.
In the beginning the duration will be unequal. Persevere until equality
is achieved.
I r . After achieving mastery over the equal duration and precision over
inhalation and exhalation on either side an attempt may be made to
retain breath Cantara kumbhaka) after inhaling.
I2. This precision is only achieved after long practice.
I 3· Retention should not disturb the rhythm and equality of inhalation
and exhalation. I f either are disturbed curtail the period of retention or
hold the breath on alternate cycles.

14. During retention after inhalation practise Mula Bandha (see
p. 437).
15. Do not attempt to hold the breath after exhalation (bahya
kumbhaka, Plate 6oo) until you have mastered retention after
inhalation Cantara kumbhaka). Then during bahya kumbhaka practise
U��iyana (Plates 593, 594) with Miila Bandha (see p. 437).

Effects
The blood receives a larger supply of oxygen in Na9-1 Sodhana than
in normal breathing, so that one feels refreshed and the nerves are
calmed and purified. The mind becomes still and lucid.

Pral)ayam as

206. Bhastrika Pranayama
Bhastrika means a bellows used in a furnace. Here the air is forcibly
drawn in and out as in a blacksmith's bellows. Hence the name. The
technique is given in two stages here.
Technique Stage I
I . Follow the technique in paras I and 2 of Ujjayi.
2. Take a fast, vigorous breath and exhale fast and forcefully. One
inhalation and one exhalation completes a cycle of Bhastrika. The
sound made resembles air rushing· through bellows.
3· Complete at a stretch IO to I 2 cycles. Then take a slow deep breath
as in Ujjayi. Retain the breath with Mula Bandha for 2 to 3 seconds,
then exhale slowly and deeply as in Ujjayi.
4· This Ujjayi type of breathing rests the lungs and the diaphragm
and prepares them for fresh cycles of Bhastrika.
5· Repeat the cycles of Bhastrika three to four times with Ujjayi
breathing in between.
6. If the sound of the air lessens, and the vigour diminishes, then
reduce their number.
7. Aft�r completion lie down in Savasana. (Plate 592)
Stage II
I.

Follow the technique in paras I and 2 of Ujjayi.

2. Adjust the thumb and finger pressure on the nostrils as explained
in the technique of Siirya Bhedana.
3· Close the left nostril completely but keep the right nostril partially
open.
4. Inhale and exhale vigorously only through the right nostril for
ro to 1 2 cycles of Bhastrika as in Stage I above.

450 Light on Yoga
5· Close the right nostril. Open the left nostril partially and repeat

Bhastrika for an equal number of cycles.
6. Release the fingers from the nostrils.

7. Take a few deep breaths as in Ujjayi.
8. Repeat the cycles on both sides three or four times, doing Ujjayi
in between.
9· After completion lie down in Savasana. (Plate 592)
Note. - The process or kriya of- 207- Kapalabhati (kapala =skull;
bhati = light, lustre) is a milder form of Bhastrika Prat)ayama. In
Kapalabhati, the inhalation is slow but the exhalation is vigorous.
There is a split second of retention after each exhalation. Do a few
cycles of Kapalabhati instead of Bhastrika if the latter breathing proves
too strenuous. Lie down in Savasana after finishing Kapalabhati.
(Plate 592)
Effects
Both Bhastrika and Kapalabhati activate and invigorate the liver,
spleen, pancreas and abdominal muscles. Thus digestion is improved,
the sinuses are drained, the eyes feel cool and one has a general sense
of exhilaration.
Caution
r . As a locomotive engine is stoked with coal to generate steam to pull
the train, so Bhastrika generates prat)a to activate the entire body.
Too much stoking burns out the boiler of the engine. So also too long
a practice of Bhastrika wears out the system as the breathing process
is forceful.

2. Persons with a weak constitution and poor lung capacity should not
attempt Bhastrika or Kapalabhati.

3· Those suffering from ear or eye complaints (pus in the ear,
detachment of the retina or glaucoma) should not attempt them either.
4· Nor should persons with high or low blood pressure.
5· If the nose starts to bleed or the ears to throb and ache, Im­

mediately stop Bhastrika or Kapalabhati.
.

6. Do not practise either for some time.

The technique of Bhamar'i Pdi�ayama is the same as that of Ujjayi.
The difference is that in Bhamar'i, during exhalation, a soft humming
sound like the murmuring of bees is made. After completion lie down
in Savasana. (Plate 592)
'

Effects
The humming sound m BhamarT Pra�ayama ts helpful m cases of
msomnta.

209. S'itali Pra"!ayiima (Plate 601)
Sitala means cool. This pra�ayama cools the system, hence the name.
Technique
1. Sit in Padmasana (Plate 104), Siddhasana (Plate 84) or Vlrasana
(Plate 89).
2. Keep the back erect and rigid and the head level. Perform the
Jiiana Mudra with the hands (see p. 433, para. 21). Here Jalandhara
Bandha is not done during inhalation but later.
3· Open the mouth and form the lips into an '0'.
4· The sides and tip of the tongue touching the teeth, from the molars
to the front teeth, should be lifted and curled up. The shape of the
tongue will resemble a fresh curled leaf about to open. (Plate 601 )

5· Protrude the curled tongue out of the lips. Draw in the air past
the curled tongue with a sibilant sound (sssssssa) to fill the lungs
completely. The air is drawn in as if through a pipette or a drinking
straw. After full inhalation withdraw the tongue and close the mouth.
6. After full inhalation, lower the head, from the nape of the neck, to
the trunk. The chin should rest in the notch between the collar­
bones just above the breast-bone. The head is now in the Jalandhara
Bandha position.
7· Now hold the breath Cantara kumbhaka) for about 5 seconds,
practising Miila Bandha (see p. 437).
8. Exhale slowly with an aspirate sound (hhuuuuuuuum) through the
nose as in Ujjayl.
9· This completes one cycle of Sitali Pra�ayama.
Io. Lift the head and repeat the cycle for 5 to IO minutes.

I 1 . After completion lie down in Savasana. (Plate 592)
Effects
This cools the system and soothes the eyes and ears. It is beneficial
in cases of low fever and biliousness. It activates the liver and the
spleen, improves digestion and relieves thirst.
Caution
I . Persons suffering from high blood pressure should omit antara
kumbhaka.
2. Those with heart trouble should not attempt Sitali Pra�ayama m
the beginning.
2IO. Sitakar"i Priir}iiya.ma
Sitakarl is that which causes cold. This ts a variation of Sitali
Pra�ayama.
Technique
Here the tongue is not curled. The lips are kept slightly parted and
only the tip of the tongue protrudes between the teeth. The tongue
is kept fiat as in its normal state. Follow the same technique as in
Sitall Pranayama.
Effects
The effects are the same as those mentioned for Sitall Prax:tayama.

Caution
Persons with high blood pressure may find greater strain in Sitakar'i
than in S'ital'i Pra1,1ayama.

Sarna Vrtti Pra'f}Ziyama

I . Sarna means the same or identical, straight, entire, whole and
complete : also similarly or in the same manner.
Vrtti means action, movement, function or operation, a course of
conduct or method.
2.

3· I n Sarna Vrtti Pra1,1ayama, therefore, an attempt is made to
achieve uniformity in the duration of all the three processes of
breathing, namely, puraka or inhalation, kumbhaka or retention, and
rechaka or exhalation in any type of pra1,1ayama. If one lasts 5 seconds
so do the others.
4· This uniformity of 5 seconds should be maintained throughout all
like Ujjay'i, Siirya
the cycles of breathing in any type of Pranayama
·
Bhedana, Na�n Sodhana, Sital'i and so on.
Caution
5 · In the beginning Sarna Vrtti Pra1,1ayama should be confined only
to inhalation (puraka) and exhalation (rechaka).
6. First, achieve uniformity of length of time in puraka and rechaka
then only attempt antara kumbhaka (retention of breath after full
inhalation).
7· Start the antara kumbhaka gradually. In the beginning, the ratio
of time for piiraka, antara kumbhaka and rechaka should be kept at
I : t : I . Very slowly increase the proportions to I : ! : I. After this is
firmly established attempt I : � : I . Only after mastering this, increase
the proportion of ' antara kumbhaka so as to achieve the ratio of
I : I : I.
8. Do not attempt bahya kumbhaka (restraint of breath after full
exhalation) until you have achieved the desired ratio of I : I : I in
piiraka, antara kumbhaka and rechaka.

If all air is expelled from the lungs, the vacuum inside and the
atmospheric pressure outside will create a tremendous strain upon the
lungs. Therefore, in the beginning, do not do both antara kumbhaka and
bahya kumbhaka together.
9·

Io. Practise antara kumbhaka and bahya kumbhaka separately or
alternately. It is beneficial to practise kumbhakas first by interspersing

454

Light on Yoga

them after two or three cycles of deep breathing with piiraka and
rechaka alone. For example do two or three cycles of deep breathing
and one cycle of antara kumbhaka. Then do two or three cycles of
deep breathing followed by one cycle of bahya kumbhaka. Start with
3 antara kumbhakas and 3 bahya kumbhakas, and increase the number
of kumbhakas very gradually.
2 I 2. Visama Vrtti Pranayama
.

.

Visama means among many other things irregular and difficult.
•

is so called because the same length of

.
.

time for inhalation, retennion and exhalation is not maintained. This
leads to interruption of rhythm and the difference in ratio creates
difficulty and danger for the pupil.
.

3· In this type of pra�ayama if full inhalation takes 5 seconds, the
breath is held Cantara kumbhaka) for 29 s�conds, and exhalation takes
IO seconds, the ratio being I : 4 : 2. At first the pupil will find it hard
to maintain the rhythm during �xhalation, but it all eases with
practice.
.

4· Conversely, if inhalation is for ro seconds, the breath is held for
20 seconds and exhalation takes 5 seconds, the ratio here being
2 : 4 : 1.
5· Again if the length of. time can be so varied that if inhalation is
for 20 seconds, retention is for 10 seconds and exhalation for 5, the
ratio being 4 : 2 : r.

6. I n one cycle of pra�ayama, one can adopt the ratios I : 2 : 4,

2 : 4 : I , and 4 : I : 2. Then these three ratios are counted as one cycle
of pra�ayama.
.

1· If bahya kumbhaka (restraint after full exhalation and before fresh
inhalation) is also observed, the combination of ratios will be greater
still.
8. If the different ratios are observed in the Viloma, Anuloma and
Pratiloma methods of pranayama (described below) in the basic
varieties of pranayamas lik� Ujjayi, Siirya Bhedana-, Nadi Sodhana,
Bhramari, Sitali and Sitakari, the number of combinations will be
astronomical.

9· No mortal could perform all these different combinations in one
lifetime.
Io. The path of Vi�ama V�tti Pra�ayama is fraught with danger. Do

Prcu:zayama

455

not, therefore, dream of attempting to practise it on your own without
the personal supervision of an experienced Guru or teacher.
I I . Due to disharmony caused by these different time ratios for
inhalation, retention and exhalation, all the systems of the body,
especially the respiratory and nervous ones, are overtaxed and unduly
strained.
12. The caution given on Sarna Vrtti Pr�ayama (see p. 453),
regarding the practice of kumbhaka in paragraphs 5 to IO, applies

with greater force in Visama Vrtti
.
.
.

I3. One now begins to realise the truth of Svatmarama's statement
in the second chapter of the Ha?ha Yoga Pradipika: 'Pra�a should be
tamed more slowly and more gradually than lions, elephants and
tigers (according to one's capacities and physical limitations) ; other­
wise it will kill the practitioner.'
V I L O M A , A N U L O M A A N D P R A T I L O M A PRA�AYAMAS

Sarna Vrtti and Visama Vrtti Pranayarna are concerned with the
maintenance of a particular ratio of time taken in inhalation, retention
and exhalation.
The Viloma, Anuloma and Pratiloma types of Pra�ayama are con­
cerned with the methods and techniques of inhalation and exhalation.
In Viloma, the inhalation or exhalation is not one continuous process,
but is done gradually with several pauses. I n Anuloma, inhalation is
through both nostrils as in Ujjayi and exhalation is alternate through
either nostril as in Na<;l'i Sodhana. In Pratiloma, all inhalation is
alternate through either nostril while all exhalation is through both
nostrils as in Ujjayi.
.

2 1 3. Viloma Pra"!ayama
Lorna means hair. The particle vi IS used to denote negation or
privation. Viloma thus means against the hair, against the grain, against
the natural order of things.
In Viloma Pra�ayama inhalation or exhalation is not one un­
interrupted continuous process, but is interrupted by several pauses.
For instance, if continuous inhalation to fill the lungs or continuous
exhalation to expel the air were to take 1 5 seconds in each case, in
Viloma there would be a pause of about 2 seconds after every third
second of inhalation or of exhalation. The process of inhalation or of
exhalation is thus lengthened to 25 seconds. The technique given
below is in two stages, which are distinct.

45b

Ltght on Yoga

Technique: Stage I
1 . Viloma PraJ?.ayama can be done either in a sitting posture or while
lying down.
2. I f done when seated, keep the back erect, lower the head to the
trunk so that the chin rests in the notch between the collar-bones on
the top of the breast-bone. This is Jalandhara Bandha. Keep the hands
in Jiiana Mudra (see p . 433, para. 21).
3· Inhale for 2 seconds, pause for 2 seconds holding the breath, again
inhale for 2 seconds, again pause for 2 seconds holding the breath,
and continue like this until the lungs are completely full.
4. Now hold the breath for 5 to IO seconds Cantara kumbhaka)
according to capacity, practising Miila Bandha (see p. 437).
5· During the pauses in the process of inhalation Miila Bandha should
be practised.
6. Exhale slowly and deeply as in Ujjayi with an aspirate sound
(huuuum). During exhalation relax the Miila Bandha.
7. This completes one cycle of the first stage of Viloma PraJ?.ayama.
8. Repeat 10 to 1 5 cycles of this first stage ·at a stretch.
Stage II
9· Rest for a minute or two.
IO. Then take a deep breath without any pauses as in Ujjayi with
a sibilant sound (sssssssa), keeping the chin on the top of the breast­
bone. Fill the lungs completely.
I 1 . Hold the breath from 5 to 1 0 seconds Cantara kumbhaka), keeping
the Mula Bandha grip.
I2. Exhale for 2 seconds and pause for 2 seconds. Again exhale for
2 seconds, pause for 2 seconds and continue like this until the lungs
are completely emptied.
1 3. During the pauses maintain the Miila Bandha grip.
14. This completes one cycle of the second stage of Viloma PraJ?.a­
yama.
I 5 . Repeat the second stage of Viloma IO to I 5 times at a stretch.
I 6. This completes Viloma Pranayama.
I 7 . Then lie down in Savasana. (Plate, 592)

Prar.tayama

457

Effects
Viloma PraJ)ayama in the first stage helps those suffering from low
blood pressure. In the second stage it benefits persons suffering from
high blood pressure.
Caution
I. The second stage of Viloma should only be done when lying down
by persons suffering from high blood pressure.
2. Those suffering from heart complaints should not attempt it until
they have mastered the Na�'i Sodhana and Ujjayi PraJ)ayamas.
214. Anuloma Pra1J.ayama
Anu means with, along with or connected : also in an orderly succes­
sion. Anuloma, therefore, means in regular gradation, with the hair
(loma=hair), along the grain or in natural order. In Anuloma
Praf)ayama, inhalation is done through both nostrils and exhalation
alternately through either nostril.
Technique
I . Sit in any comfortable positiOn like Padmasana (Plate 104),
Siddhasana (Plate 84) or Virasana (Plate 89).
-

2. Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk and
rest the chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the
breast-bone. (This is the Jalandhara Bandha.)
3. Inhale deeply through both nostrils as in Ujjayi until the lungs are
fully filled.
4. Hold the breath after inhalation Cantara kumbhaka) from 5 to 10
seconds according to capacity, maintaining Miila Bandha (see p. 437).
5· Bring the right hand to the nose as described in Siirya Bhedana
Pranayama, relax the Miila Bandha and exhale slowly from the partially
opened right nostril, keeping the left one completely blocked. Completely empty the lungs and then lower the hand.
•

'

6. Inhale through both nostrils, until the lungs are filled as in para. 3·
7· Hold the breath after inhalation (antara kumbhaka) from 5 to 10
seconds according to capacity, maintaining Miila Bandha. The reten­
tion of breath described in para. 4 and in this para. should be of equal
length.
8. Again bring the right hand to the nose. Release the Miila Bandha
and close the right nostril completely. Now keep the left nostril

458

Light on Yoga

partially open, and exhale slowly and deeply to empty the lungs
completely.
9· This completes one cycle of Anuloma PraJ?ayama.
Io. Do 5 to 8 cycles at a stretch.
I I . Then lie down in Savasana. (Plate 592)

Effects
The effects are the same as those of Ujjayi, Nadl Sodhana and Siirya
Bhedana.
·

Caution
I . In Anuloma PdiJ?ayama, the exhalation lasts longer than the
inhalation. This leads to a variation in the rhythm of breathing. This
is difficult and should therefore be done by advanced pupils only.

2. Persons suffering from blood pressure or heart ailments and nervous
disorders should not attempt it as the results may be disastrous.
2 I 5. Pratiloma Pranayama
Prati means opposite. This type of PdiJ?ayama is the converse of
Anuloma. In it inhalation is alternate through either nostril and then
exhalation is through both nostrils as in Ujjayi.
Technique
r . Sit in any comfortable posltlon like Padmasana (Plate 104),
Siddhasana (Plate 84) or Vlrasana (Plate 89).
2. Keep the back erect and rigid. Lower the head to the trunk. Rest
the chin in the notch between the collar-bones just above the breast­
bone. This is the Jalandhara Bandha.
3· Stretch the left arm. Rest the back of the left wrist on the left
knee. Perform the Jiiana Mudra with the left hand (see 203, 3).
4· Bend the right arm at the elbow, and the index and middle fingers
towards the palm, keeping them passive. Bring the ring and little
fingers towards the thumb. (Plate 598)
Place the right thumb on the right side of the nose just below the
nasal bone and the ring and little fingers on the left side of the nose
just below the nasal bone, just above the curve of the fatty tissue of
the nostrils.
s.

6. Press the ring and little fingers to block the left side of the nose
completely.

Pra1;1ayama

459

7· With the right thumb, press the right side of the fatty tissue so
as to make the outer edge of the nostril parallel to the lower edge of
the cartilage of the septum.
8. The right thumb is bent at the top joint and the tip of the thumb
is placed at a right angle to the septum. (Plate 599)
9· Now inhale slowly and deeply, controlling the aperture of the right
nostril with the tip of the thumb nearer the nail. Fill the lungs to the
brim (puraka).
IO. Then block the right nostril so that both the nostrils are now
· blocked.

I 1 . Hold the breath for about 5 to I O seconds (antara kumbhaka)

and stay in Miila Bandha (see p. 437).

I2. Lower the right hand. Release the Miila Bandha grip. Exhale
slowly and deeply as in Ujjayi (203) until the lungs are completely
empty.
I 3. Again raise the right hand t9 the nose. Inhale through the partially
opened left nostril slowly and deeply, keeping the right nostril com­
pletely closed.
I4. Fill the lungs to the brim.

I5. Hold the breath with the Miila Bandha grip from 5 to I O seconds.

The retention of breath (antara kumbhaka) after inhalation from either
nostril should be of equal duration.
I 6. Lower the right hand, release the Miila Bandha, exhale slowly and
deeply, completely expelling all air from the lungs as in Ujjayi.
I7. This completes one cycle of Pratiloma Pra�ayama.
I 8. Do 5 to 8 cycles at a stretch.

I9. Then lie down in Savasana. (Plate 592)
Effects
The effects are the same as those of Ujjayi, Na91 Sodhana and Siirya
Bhedana Pra�ayama.
Caution
I. Here, as in Anuloma, there is variation in the breath rhythm as the
inhalation is longer than the exhalation. This difficult type of
pra�ayama should, therefore, only be done by advanced pupils.

602

Prar)ayama

46 r

2. Persons suffering from blood pressure, heart ailments and nervous
disorders should not attempt it, as the results will be disastrous.

216. Sahita and Kevala Kumbhaka Pra'f}ayama
Sahita means accompanied by, together with or associated with.
When pr�yama practices are observed with the intentional aid and
deliberate accompaniment of bahya and antara kumbhaka, they are
known as Sahita Kumbhaka Pra�ayamas.
Kevala means isolated, pure, absolute and perfect. When the practices
of kumbhaka becomes instinctive, they are called Kevala Kumbhaka.
When the pupil has mastered Kevala Kumbhaka, he has isolated
himself from the world and is in tune with the Infinite. He has
obtained a measure of control over one of the most subtle and powerful
of elements which can pervade the smallest crevice as well as the
vast sky. His mind is completely absorbed with Pr�a and becomes
as free as Pram:t
. itself.
As a wind drives smoke and impurities from the atmosphere,
pra�ayama drives away the impurities of the body and the mind. Then,
says Pataiijali, the DIVINE FIRE within blazes forth in its full glory and
the mind becomes fit for concentration (dhar�a) and meditation
(dhyana). ( Yoga Sutras, chapter II, 52 and 53.) This takes a long time.
By degrees is the darkness banished by the dawn.

IOist to I08th week

As the 95th week but do Vipari'ta Dandasana
(5I6) from Salamba
.
Sir�asana I (1 84) and again swing back to Sir�asana I. For many this
period is too short for acquiring control of Viparita Da�<;tasana. Con­
centrate then on this and shorten the time spent on the other asanas.
.

.

I09th to I 25th week

Follow the 95th week course, add Vipari'ta D�<;tasana (5 I 6) as above
and learn Viparita Chakrasana (488 to 499) by doing it I5 times daily
at a stretch. It is a difficult asana and it needs perseverance to perfect
it. If you cannot do so in this period, do not lose heart but continue
with it for several more weeks.

Dwipada Vipari'ta Da�f<;Jasana (516) and Kapotasana (507).
Note- Viparfta Chakrasana (488 to 499) is a strenuous asana so that one
on
may not be able to do Pranayama daily. In that event, do Pranayama
.
alternate days and the cycles of Sfr�asana and Sarvangasana on alternate
days. Also, if the body is stiff and you cannot cope with the table as
given above, then spread the asanas and the weeks to your convenience.
Unless you improve these back-bending postures you cannot proceed
much with the other difficult asanas. I t is also possible that those over
35 will find it difficult to master Viparita Chakrasana in so short a time.
I have instructed many people of different ages and some learn quicker
than others. But there is no age limit for these asanas.

Paripoorna Matsyendrasana (336 and 339) may take a longer time to
master than I have anticipated. One should try this asana every day
irrespective of failures. If one cannot master the asanas of Course Three
so far dealt with in the stipulated period, spread them out over several
more weeks.
As the other asanas take years to master, I shall try my best to give
a resume for each day's practice of all these asanas.

To start with many fail to advance further than the exercises given for
the I 66th week. But by tenacity and persistent practice one can master
every asana and priiJ:?.iiyama recommended in this book. In my earlier
years it took me four years of hard work in which optimism and
pessimism were balanced equally. When you have achieved mastery of
the I 66th week of the course, I ask you in all sincerity to persevere in
the work you have undertaken happy in what you have attained and
never despairing at any temporary failure. Most people, however, take
far longer than I have stipulated to master all these asanas with comfort
and ease. When you have perfected all those detailed in this third course,
you can divide them up into a week's course as suggested below. Then
by daily practice, learn to remain master of them all.

Appendix II
Curative Asanas for Various Diseases
After working for 25 years as a teacher, I am giving groups of asanas
for different functional and organic ailments and diseases, based on
experiences with my pupils.
I have listed a number of asanas under each complaint, so it is
advisable to seek the guidance of an experienced teacher and to adopt
them according to one's ability, suppleness of body and constitution.
When practising asanas it is important to use common sense and to
watch the reactions of your body, thereby judging the time that you
stay in them.

god of Death).' Nachiketa went down to the realm of
Death and obtained three boons, the last of which
was the knowledge of the secret of life after death.
Yama tried to divert Nachiketa from obtaining his
wish by offering the greatest earthly pleasures, but
Nachiketa was not swayed from his purpose and
ultimately Yama gave him the knowledge desired.

five mentioned by Pataiijali are: non-violence, truth,

from the root 'yuj' meaning to join, to yoke, to
concentrate one's attention on. I t is the union of
our will to the will of God, a poise of the soul which

The chief aim of yoga is to teach the means by
which the human soul may be completely united
with the Supreme Spirit pervading the universe and
thus secure absolution.

of 1 85 terse aphorisms on yoga and it is divided

seeker comes across in his quest and the state of
absolution.
