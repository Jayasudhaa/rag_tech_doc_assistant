Dakshinamurthy Stotram: Word-by-Word
Explanation
This document provides a detailed, word-by-word explanation of the Dakshinamurthy
Stotram, composed by Adi Shankaracharya. The explanation delves into the meaning of
each Sanskrit word within the context of the verses, aiming for a comprehensive
understanding of this profound hymn.

(Dhyānam - Meditation Verse)
Verse 1:

Explanation:
This opening verse sets the stage for meditation upon Lord Dakshinamurthy. We begin
with

(mauna-vyākhyā), signifying the profound exposition delivered

through silence. This silence is not mere absence of sound but a powerful
communication that

(prakaṭita), reveals or manifests, the

(para-

brahma-tattvam), the very essence or principle (tattvam) of the Supreme (para) Brahman
(brahma), the ultimate reality. The Lord is described as

(yuvānam), eternally

youthful, symbolizing timeless wisdom that never ages. Paradoxically, this youthful Guru
is seated
specifically

(varṣiṣṭhānte), amidst the most venerable and aged sages,
(vasad), dwelling or seated,

(ṛṣigaṇaiḥ), groups of sages, who are

(āvṛtam), surrounded by,
(brahma-niṣṭhaiḥ), firmly

established in the knowledge and experience of Brahman.
He is hailed as
whose hand,

(ācāryendram), the king or best among teachers (ācārya),
(kara-kalita), holds or displays the

(cin-mudram). This

sacred hand gesture, the Chin Mudra (often formed by joining the thumb and index
finger), symbolizes the union of the individual consciousness (index finger) with the
Supreme Consciousness (thumb), and the three extended fingers represent the three

states of consciousness or the three gunas transcended. He is

(ānanda-

mūrtim), the very embodiment (mūrti) of bliss (ānanda). Furthermore, he is
(svātmārāmam), one who rejoices (ārāmam) in his own (sva) Self (ātma),
finding complete fulfillment within. This inner joy is reflected externally as
(mudita-vadanam), a blissful or joyful (mudita) face (vadanam). To this divine form,
(dakṣiṇāmūrtim), Lord Dakshinamurthy,

(īḍe), I offer my praise and

worship.
This verse beautifully encapsulates the image of Dakshinamurthy as the youthful, silent
teacher, surrounded by aged disciples, imparting the highest knowledge of Brahman
through his blissful presence and the symbolic Chin Mudra.

(Maṅgalācaraṇam - Invocation Verses)
Verse 2:

Explanation:
This verse offers salutations to Lord Dakshinamurthy, describing his physical setting and
spiritual significance. The verse begins by locating the Lord

(vaṭa-viṭapi-

samīpe), near the banyan tree. The banyan tree (vaṭa) holds profound symbolism in
Hindu philosophy, representing the eternal, ever-expanding universe with its aerial roots
growing downward to form new trunks. The Lord is

(bhūmi-bhāge

niṣaṇṇam), seated on a portion of the earth or ground. This earthly positioning
symbolizes his accessibility despite his transcendent nature.
He is described as

(sakala-muni-janānāṃ jñāna-dātāram),

the bestower (dātāram) of knowledge (jñāna) to all (sakala) sages (muni-janānām). The
word

(ārāt) suggests that this bestowal of knowledge happens from nearby or in

close proximity, emphasizing the intimate relationship between the guru and disciples
despite the vast difference in their spiritual evolution.
The verse continues by exalting him as

(tri-bhuvana-gurum), the teacher

of the three worlds (heaven, earth, and the netherworld), and

(īśam), the supreme

lord or controller. He is specifically identified as

(dakṣiṇāmūrti-

devam), the deity Dakshinamurthy, whose name itself carries significance – "dakṣiṇa"
meaning south (the direction he faces) and also signifying compassion, while "mūrti"
means form or embodiment.
Most importantly, he is

(janana-maraṇa-duḥkha-cheda dakṣam),

expert (dakṣam) in severing (cheda) the sorrows (duḥkha) of birth (janana) and death
(maraṇa). This highlights his role in liberating beings from the cycle of samsara through
the imparting of supreme knowledge. To this divine form, the composer offers
(namāmi), I bow or salute with reverence.
Verse 3:

Explanation:
This verse captures the paradoxical and profound teaching methodology of
Dakshinamurthy. It begins with

(citram), expressing wonder or strangeness at the

scene being described. What is this wonder? It is found

(vaṭa-taroḥ mūle), at

the root or base of the banyan tree, where
disciples, sit before

(vṛddhāḥ śiṣyāḥ), aged

(gurur-yuvā), a young guru. This reversal of the

conventional age dynamic between teacher and student highlights the timeless, ageless
nature of spiritual wisdom, which transcends physical maturity.
The verse then reveals the extraordinary teaching method:
(gurostu maunaṃ vyākhyānam), the guru's exposition or teaching (vyākhyānam) is
silence (maunam). This silence is not empty or meaningless but is the most profound
communication of the inexpressible truth of non-duality. The result of this silent
teaching is equally remarkable:

(śiṣyāstu-cchinna-saṃśayāḥ),

the disciples' doubts (saṃśayāḥ) are severed (chinna). This demonstrates the power of
direct transmission of knowledge beyond words, where the very presence of the
enlightened master dispels ignorance in receptive disciples.
Verse 4:

Explanation:

This verse offers salutations while highlighting three essential aspects of Lord
Dakshinamurthy's nature. First, he is

(nidhaye sarva-vidyānām), a

treasure house or repository (nidhaye) of all (sarva) knowledge or learning (vidyānām).
This emphasizes his role as the source of all forms of knowledge, both spiritual and
worldly.
Second, he is

(bhiṣaje bhava-rogiṇām), a physician or healer (bhiṣaje)

for those afflicted with the disease of worldly existence (bhava-rogiṇām). Here, the cycle
of birth and death (samsara) is metaphorically described as a disease, and
Dakshinamurthy is the doctor who provides the cure through spiritual knowledge.
Third, he is

(gurave sarva-lokānām), the teacher (gurave) of all (sarva)

worlds (lokānām). This establishes his universal role as the supreme preceptor, guiding
beings across all realms of existence. To this divine form,
(dakṣiṇāmūrtaye namaḥ), salutations to Dakshinamurthy are offered.
Verse 5:

Explanation:
This verse begins with

(oṃ namaḥ), offering salutations with the sacred syllable

Om, and continues to describe Lord Dakshinamurthy's essential nature. He is
(praṇavārthāya), the embodiment of the meaning of Pranava (the syllable
Om). Pranava represents the primordial sound from which all creation emerges and into
which it dissolves, and Dakshinamurthy is the living manifestation of this cosmic
principle.
He is also

(śuddha-jñānaika-mūrtaye), the sole (eka) embodiment

(mūrtaye) of pure (śuddha) knowledge (jñāna). This emphasizes that his very essence is
untainted, absolute knowledge, free from any trace of ignorance or misconception.
Furthermore, he is

(nirmalāya), spotless or pure, indicating his freedom from all

impurities of mind and body, and

(praśāntāya), perfectly peaceful or tranquil,

reflecting the state of absolute inner calm that comes from complete self-realization. To
this divine form,
Dakshinamurthy are offered again.
Verse 6:

(dakṣiṇāmūrtaye namaḥ), salutations to

Explanation:
This verse continues the salutations while revealing deeper aspects of Lord
Dakshinamurthy's nature. He is

(cid-ghanāya), a solid mass or condensation of

consciousness (cit). This metaphor suggests that consciousness, which is typically
understood as formless and all-pervading, appears concentrated or solidified in the form
of Dakshinamurthy, making the abstract principle tangible and accessible.
He is

(maheśāya), the great lord or ruler, indicating his supreme status among

deities. His physical location is again emphasized as

(vaṭa-mūla-nivāsine),

one who dwells at the root of the banyan tree, reinforcing the symbolic connection
between the expansive, immortal banyan and the eternal wisdom he represents.
Most significantly, he is

(sac-cid-ānanda-rūpāya), the embodiment

(rūpāya) of Existence-Consciousness-Bliss (sat-cit-ānanda). This triad represents the
ultimate nature of Brahman or absolute reality in Vedantic philosophy: pure existence
(sat), pure consciousness (cit), and pure bliss (ānanda). By describing Dakshinamurthy
as the form of Satchidananda, the verse identifies him with the highest reality itself. To
this divine form,

(dakṣiṇāmūrtaye namaḥ), salutations are offered.

Verse 7:

Explanation:
This verse reveals the non-dual nature of Lord Dakshinamurthy by addressing the
apparent distinctions between God, Guru, and Self. The phrase
(īśvaro gurur-ātmeti) presents three seemingly distinct entities: Ishvara (God), Guru
(teacher), and Atman (Self), connected by "iti" (thus). These three are then unified
through the description

(mūrti-bheda-vibhāgine), one who

differentiates or divides (vibhāgine) the differences (bheda) in forms (mūrti). This
suggests that while these appear as separate entities to the unenlightened mind,
Dakshinamurthy reveals their essential unity.
He is further described as

(vyoma-vad vyāpta-dehāya), one whose

body (dehāya) pervades (vyāpta) like (vad) the sky (vyoma). This beautiful metaphor
illustrates his all-pervading nature, like the limitless expanse of space that contains

everything yet remains untouched and unaffected. Just as the sky encompasses all
forms without being limited by them, Dakshinamurthy's consciousness pervades all
existence while transcending all limitations. To this divine form,
(dakṣiṇāmūrtaye namaḥ), salutations are offered.

(Stotram - Main Hymn)
Verse 1:

Explanation:
This profound verse introduces the central philosophical concept of the Dakshinamurthy
Stotram—the illusory nature of the perceived world and the reality of the Self. The verse
begins with

(viśvam), the universe or world, which is described as
(darpaṇa-dṛśyamāna-nagarī-tulyam), similar to a city seen in a

mirror. This powerful metaphor illustrates how the world appears real yet is merely a
reflection, having no independent existence apart from its source. Furthermore, this
universe is

(nijāntargatam), contained within one's own self, suggesting

that the entire cosmos exists within consciousness rather than externally.
The verse continues with
the Self, yet
outside,

(paśyan), seeing or perceiving,

(ātmani), within

(māyayā), through the power of illusion, it appears

(iva), as if,

(udbhūtam), arisen or manifested,

(bahiḥ),

(yathā), just as,

(nidrayā), in sleep or dream. This beautiful analogy compares our perception of
the world to a dream—though appearing external and real during the dream state, upon
awakening we realize it was entirely within our consciousness.
The verse then introduces

(yaḥ), who or the one who,

(sākṣātkurute),

directly realizes,

(prabodha-samaye), at the time of awakening or

enlightenment,

(svātmānam), one's own Self,

(eva), alone or only,

(advayam), non-dual or without a second. This describes the moment of spiritual
awakening when one directly perceives the non-dual nature of reality, recognizing that
the Self alone exists without any secondary entity.

To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the

(namaḥ), salutations,

(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 2:

Explanation:
This verse elaborates on the manifestation of the universe from the unmanifest reality,
using powerful metaphors to illustrate this process. It begins with
seed,

(antaḥ), inside,

(iva), like,

(bījasya), of the

(aṅkuraḥ), a sprout. This metaphor

compares the universe to a sprout contained within a seed—though invisible and
undifferentiated in the seed form, it contains the potential for the entire tree. Similarly,
(jagat), the world,

(idam), this, was originally

(prāk), before (creation),

(nirvikalpam), undifferentiated or without distinctions.
The verse continues to describe how this undifferentiated reality becomes the diverse
universe:

(punaḥ), again or subsequently, through

illusion,

(kalpita), created or imagined,

(māyā), the power of

(deśa), space,

(kalanā), calculation or reckoning, it becomes
diverse,

(kāla), time,

(vaicitrya), variegated or

(citrīkṛtam), made colorful or manifold. This explains how the

formless, timeless absolute reality appears as the diverse universe with distinct objects,
beings, and experiences through the creative power of Maya.
The verse then introduces two powerful similes:
like,
yogi,

(māyāvī), a magician,

(vijṛmbhayati), expands or manifests, and
(iva), like,

(yaḥ), who,

(iva),

(mahā-yogī), a great

(svecchayā), by his own will or desire. These

comparisons illustrate how the Supreme Being manifests the universe—like a magician
creating illusions that appear real to the audience, or like a great yogi who can
materialize objects through the power of concentration.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(namaḥ), salutations,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the
(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 3:

Explanation:
This verse delves into the nature of reality and the transformative power of selfrealization. It begins with

(yasya), whose,

(sphuraṇam), vibration or manifestation, is

(eva), indeed or alone,
(sat), existence or reality,

(ātmakam), having the nature of. This indicates that the essential nature of all
manifestation is existence itself. Yet paradoxically, this manifestation appears as
(asat), non-existence or unreality,
or purpose,

(kalpa), imagination,

(arthakam), meaning

(bhāsate), shines or appears. This complex phrase conveys that while

the universe appears as distinct objects with names and forms, its true nature is
undifferentiated existence, and the apparent diversity is merely conceptual, like objects
seen in a dream.
The verse continues with
art,"

(iti), thus,

(sākṣāt), directly,

(tattvamasi), "That thou

(veda-vacasā), by the words of the Vedas. "Tat Tvam Asi" is

one of the Mahavakyas (great sayings) from the Upanishads, declaring the identity of the
individual self with the Supreme Self. The verse states that
(bodhayati), teaches or enlightens,

(yaḥ), who,

(āśritān), those who take refuge or

disciples, through this profound statement.
The transformative power of this realization is then described:
(sākṣātkaraṇāt), from direct realization,
not,

(punaḥ), again,

(āvṛttiḥ), return,

(yat), which,

(bhavet), would be, (na),

(bhava), worldly existence,

(ambhonidhau), in the ocean. This indicates that direct realization of one's
identity with the Supreme Self leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death,
metaphorically described as the ocean of worldly existence.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(namaḥ), salutations,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the
(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 4:

Explanation:
This verse employs a beautiful metaphor to illustrate how consciousness illuminates
both the inner and outer worlds. It begins with
or openings,
great,

(ghaṭa), pot,

(dīpa), lamp,

(nānā), various,

(udara), inside,

(chidra), holes

(sthita), situated,

(prabhā), light,

(mahā),

(bhāsvaram), shining. This complex

metaphor compares consciousness to a bright lamp placed inside a pot with multiple
holes—the light shines through these openings, illuminating the surroundings. Similarly,
consciousness, though singular, appears to manifest through various sense organs.
The verse continues with
whose,

(jñānam), knowledge or consciousness,

(tu), but or indeed,

(dvārā), through,

(cakṣuḥ), eye,
(bahiḥ), outside,

(ādi), etc.,

(yasya),

(karaṇa), organ,

(spandate), vibrates or moves.

This describes how consciousness, though inherently unmoving, appears to flow
outward through the sense organs to perceive external objects, just as the light from the
lamp streams through the holes in the pot.
The verse then reveals a profound insight:

(jānāmi), I know,

(tam), him or that,

(bhāntam), shining,

(eva), alone or only,

(anubhāti), shines after or follows,

(etat), this,

(iti), thus,

(samastam), entire,

(jagat), world. This indicates that the entire universe is illuminated or known only
because of the self-luminous consciousness that is our true nature. The "I know"
experience, which is the essence of consciousness, is primary, and the known world is
secondary, deriving its apparent reality from this consciousness.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(namaḥ), salutations,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the
(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.

Verse 5:

Explanation:
This verse addresses the misconceptions about self-identity and offers salutations to the
one who dispels such delusions. It begins by describing various erroneous
identifications:

(deham), body,

(prāṇam), vital force or breath,

also,

(indriyāṇi), sense organs,

(api), also,

changing,

(buddhim), intellect, (ca), and,

(api),

(calām), moving or
(śūnyam), void or emptiness,

(viduḥ), they know or consider. This refers to various philosophical schools that
identify the self with the physical body, vital energy, sense faculties, intellect, or even
with nothingness.
The verse then characterizes those holding such views:
child,

(andha), blind,

but,

(aham), I,

(jaḍa), inert or dull,

(iti), thus,

(strī), woman,

(bāla),

(upamāḥ), comparable to,

(bhrāntāḥ), deluded,

(tu),

(bhṛśam), greatly,

(vādinaḥ), disputants or arguers. This powerful statement compares those who
misidentify the self with the body or mind to women (traditionally considered
emotionally driven), children (immature), blind persons (lacking vision), or inert objects
(lacking discrimination)—all metaphors for incomplete understanding.
The verse then offers salutations to the one who destroys these misconceptions:
(māyā), illusion,

(śakti), power,

(vilāsa), play,

(mahā), great,

(vyāmoha), delusion,

(kalpita), created,

(saṃhāriṇe), to the destroyer. This

describes Lord Dakshinamurthy as the one who dispels the great delusion created by the
play of Maya's power, revealing the true nature of the self beyond all limited
identifications.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(namaḥ), salutations,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the
(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 6:

Explanation:
This verse explores the nature of consciousness during deep sleep and its continuity
across different states of awareness. It begins with a striking simile:
(the mythological entity causing eclipses),
(divākara), sun,

(indu), moon,

(rāhu), Rahu

(grasta), swallowed or seized,

(sadṛśaḥ), similar to. This compares the self in

deep sleep to the sun or moon during an eclipse—though temporarily obscured, its
essential nature remains unchanged. The cause of this obscuration is
illusion,

(māyā),

(samācchādanāt), due to being covered or veiled.

The verse continues to describe the state of deep sleep:
existence alone,

(sanmātraḥ), pure

(karaṇa), organs or instruments of perception,

(upasaṃharaṇataḥ), due to withdrawal. This indicates that in deep sleep, when all sense
organs and mental faculties are withdrawn, consciousness exists in its pure form as
undifferentiated existence, without the subject-object duality characteristic of waking
and dream states. This state is described as
(suṣuptaḥ), deep sleep,

(yaḥ), who,

(abhūt), became,

(pumān), person.

The verse then reveals a profound insight about the continuity of consciousness:
(prāk), before,
awakening,

(asvāpsam), I slept,
(samaye), at the time of,

(iti), thus,

(prabodha),

(yaḥ), who,

(pratyabhijñāyate), is recognized or remembered. This refers to the experience upon
waking of remembering that "I slept well," indicating that some form of consciousness
persisted during deep sleep to later enable this recognition. This continuity of awareness
across different states is a key pointer to our true nature as ever-present consciousness.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(namaḥ), salutations,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the
(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 7:

Explanation:
This verse explores the unchanging nature of the Self amidst the changing phases of life
and states of consciousness. It begins with

(bālyādiṣu), in childhood etc.,

referring to the various stages of life from childhood through youth, adulthood, and old
age. It continues with

(api), also,

(jāgradādiṣu), in waking state etc.,

referring to the three states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. The
phrase

(tathā), likewise,

(sarvāsu), in all,

(avasthāsu), states,

(api), also, emphasizes that this applies to all possible conditions of existence.
Despite these ever-changing states, which are described as

(vyāvṛttāsu),

changing or distinct, there is something that remains constant:
(anuvartamānam), following or continuing,
within,

(aham), I,

(sphurantam), shining or pulsating,

(iti), thus,

(antaḥ),

(sadā), always. This refers to

the unchanging sense of "I" or self-awareness that persists through all changes of body,
mind, and states of consciousness—the eternal witness that never becomes an object of
experience but is the subject of all experience.
The verse then praises Lord Dakshinamurthy as the one who
one's own Self,

(prakaṭīkaroti), reveals or makes manifest,

to those who worship or contemplate,
or symbol,

(svātmānam),

(yaḥ), who,

(bhajatām),

(mudrayā), by the gesture

(abhadrayā), auspicious. This refers to the Chin Mudra formed by

Dakshinamurthy's hand, symbolizing the union of individual consciousness with
universal consciousness.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(namaḥ), salutations,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the
(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 8:

Explanation:
This verse examines how Maya (illusion) creates the perception of duality and
relationships in the world. It begins with

(viśvam), universe or world,

(paśyati), sees or perceives. The verse then enumerates various ways in which we
perceive duality and relationships:

(kārya), effect,

(kāraṇa), cause,

(tayā),

by that relationship—referring to how we categorize phenomena as causes and their
effects. Next is

(sva), own,

(svāmi), master,

(sambandhatah), by

relation—referring to the concepts of possession and ownership.
The verse continues with more examples of relational perception:
(ācārya), teacher,
(pitṛ), father,

(tayā), by that relationship,

(putra), son,

(ādi), etc.,

(śiṣya), disciple,

(tathaiva), likewise,

(ātmanā), by the self,

(bhedataḥ), by difference or distinction. These examples illustrate how we perceive the
world through the lens of various relationships and roles, all of which imply duality and
separation.
The verse then identifies the source of these dualistic perceptions:
dream,

(jāgrati), in waking state,

(puruṣaḥ), person,

(māyā), illusion,

(vā), or,

(yaḥ), who,

(svapne), in
(eṣaḥ), this,

(paribhrāmitaḥ), deluded or

bewildered. This indicates that whether in dream or waking state, the individual self is
deluded by Maya into perceiving duality where there is only non-dual reality.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(namaḥ), salutations,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the
(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 9:

Explanation:

This verse reveals the entire universe as manifestations of the Supreme Being. It begins
by enumerating the eight forms through which the divine manifests:
(ambhāṃsi), waters,
sky or ether,

(analaḥ), fire,

(ahaḥ), day or sun,

moon,

(bhūḥ), earth,

(anilaḥ), air,

(ambaram),

(nāthaḥ), lord or moon,

(himāṃśuḥ),

(pumān), person or conscious being. These eight forms represent the five

elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) plus the sun, moon, and the conscious
experiencer—encompassing the entire manifest universe.
The verse continues with

(iti), thus,

(ābhāti), appears or shines,

(carācara), moving and non-moving,
(idam), this,

(yasya), whose,

(ātmakam), having the nature of,

(eva), indeed,

(mūrti), form,

(aṣṭakam), eight-fold. This indicates that the entire universe of moving and non-moving
beings appears as the eight-fold manifestation of the Supreme Being.
The verse then emphasizes the non-dual nature of reality: (na), not,
other,

(kiñcana), anything,

those who reflect or investigate,
from the supreme,

(vidyate), exists,

(anyat),

(vimṛśatām), for

(yasmāt), from whom,

(parasmāt),

(vibhoḥ), from the all-pervading. This profound statement

asserts that for those who deeply reflect on the nature of reality, nothing exists apart
from the Supreme Being—all apparent diversity resolves into the non-dual absolute.
To this divine form,

(tasmai), to him,

auspicious form of the teacher,

(śrī-guru-mūrtaye), to the

(namaḥ), salutations,

(idam), this,

(śrī-dakṣiṇāmūrtaye), to the auspicious Dakshinamurthy, are
offered.
Verse 10:

Explanation:
This concluding verse describes the fruits of studying, contemplating, and reciting this
stotram. It begins with
(iti), thus,

(sarvātmatvam), the state of being the Self of all,
(sphuṭīkṛtam), made clear or revealed,

(yasmāt), from which,

(amuṣmin), in this,

(idam), this,
(stave), hymn or

praise. This indicates that the central teaching of this stotram is the non-dual nature of
reality—that one's true Self is the Self of all beings.
The verse then describes the spiritual practices related to this stotram:

(tena), by

that,

(tat), that,

(asya), of this,

(śravaṇāt), from hearing or listening,

(artha), meaning,

(mananāt), from reflection or contemplation,

(dhyānāt), from meditation, (ca), and,

(saṃkīrtanāt), from recitation or

singing. These four practices—hearing, reflecting, meditating, and reciting—constitute
the traditional approach to internalizing spiritual teachings.
The verse then describes the fruits of these practices:
selfhood,

(mahā), great,

with,

(syāt), would be,

(sarva), all,

(vibhūti), glory or manifestation,

(ātmatva),
(sahitam),

(īśvaratvam), lordship or divine status,

(svataḥ), naturally or spontaneously,

(siddhyet), would be accomplished.

This indicates that through these practices, one naturally attains the state of being the
Self of all, accompanied by divine glory or manifestation.
The verse concludes with

(tat), that,

(punaḥ), again or furthermore,

(aṣṭadhā), eight-fold,

(pariṇatam), transformed or manifested, (ca), and,

(aiśvaryam), sovereignty or divine powers,

(avyāhatam),

unobstructed or unhindered. This refers to the eight supernatural powers (siddhis)
traditionally associated with spiritual attainment, such as becoming infinitesimally
small, infinitely large, extremely light, extremely heavy, obtaining anything desired,
irresistible will, supremacy over all, and fulfillment of all desires.
Concluding Verse:

Explanation:
This final verse returns to the image of Lord Dakshinamurthy seated beneath the banyan
tree, bringing the stotram full circle. It begins with
tree,

(samīpe), near,

(vaṭa), banyan tree,

(bhūmi-bhāge), on the ground,

(viṭapi),
(niṣaṇṇam),

seated. This reestablishes the physical setting of the divine teacher.
The verse continues with

(sakala), all,

(muni-janānām), of sages,

(jñāna-dātāram), bestower of knowledge,

Conclusion
The Dakshinamurthy Stotram stands as one of Adi Shankaracharya's most profound
compositions, encapsulating the essence of Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Through its
verses, it reveals the illusory nature of the perceived world, the reality of the Self, and
the path to liberation through self-knowledge. The stotram employs powerful
metaphors and analogies to convey abstract philosophical concepts, making them
accessible to spiritual aspirants.
Central to the stotram is the paradoxical figure of Dakshinamurthy himself—the youthful
teacher surrounded by aged disciples, imparting the highest knowledge through silence.
This image symbolizes the timeless, eternal nature of self-knowledge that transcends
conventional modes of communication and learning.
The stotram's verses systematically dismantle misconceptions about self-identity,
revealing that our true nature is not the body, senses, mind, or intellect, but the
unchanging consciousness that illuminates all experience. Through contemplation of
these teachings and devotion to Dakshinamurthy, the seeker is guided toward the direct
realization of their identity with the Supreme Self, leading to liberation from the cycle of
birth and death.
This word-by-word explanation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this
sacred text, honoring both its philosophical depth and devotional significance in the
Hindu tradition.
